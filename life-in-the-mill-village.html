                  lot. A large tree that offered shade in Martin's back yard is
                  still standing in the parking lot by Kerr Drug and George's

        <p>According to James Eubanks, who grew up on Case Street, one of the
          attractions of Erwin Park (near present-day Duke School for Children)
          was a metal cage with several monkeys inside. Employees at Erwin Auditorium
          cared for the animals and during a feeding, two monkeys accidentally
          jumped out of the cage. The monkeys ran across Erwin Road and down into
          a pasture that Hoy and Charity Eudy used for their cows, sheep and goats
          (Mr. Eudy was a Weaver at Erwin Mills). The monkeys were never caught
          and as a result, the area around Swift and Case became known as "Monkey
          Bottom." </p>

          of the Mill Village in Durham, by Osha Gray Davidson, <i><b>The Best
          of Enemies: Race and Redemption in the New South</b></i> (Scribner).</font>
        </p>
        <p>The houses were surprisingly alike on either side of this crucial dividing
          line [railroad tracks separating white Durham from black]: small, dark,
          and cramped. They had front porches in identical states of disrepair,
          tin roofs warped and rusted to a similar dull red hue, and flyblown
          outhouses in each dirt backyard. At night these houses glowed with the
          flickering yellow light of kerosene lanterns that lent the district
          an aura considered quaint -- by those who didn't have to live there...
        <p>African-Americans have always occupied the lowest level of the Southland's
          great social pyramid, but as the new century progressed the region seemed
          unable to decide who it despised more: blacks or poor whites... Mill
          employees labored at dangerous jobs under miserable conditions -- and
          for poverty wages -- breathing in cotton dust until their lungs were
          brown with the stuff and they suffocated... Before long, workers were
          simply born into mill life and very few escaped it. And although it
          was their underpaid labor that transformed Durham into the Jewel of
          the New South, their presence in "better areas" of town was not welcome.
          On rare occasions that they ventured out of their neighborhoods, mill
          hands were immediately recognized by their deathly white pallor. Passing
          them on the street, businessmen might smile to one another and exchange
          a single sharp-edged word: "linthead."
        <p>... The paternalism that governed relations between white planters
          and slaves in the Old South was extended in the New South to include
          poor white factory workers. In the early days, mill owners greeted workers
          by their first name each morning, inquiring about the health of children,
          who might also be known by their name. If a worker fell ill, the mill
          boss would often pay the doctor's bill. One owner hired a full-time
          nurse to care for workers and their families. When a smattering of education
          was considered a good thing for workers, some mills offered classes
          at night at no charge. Like a stern but caring "daddy," William Erwin,
          the tall bespectacled president of the Erwin Cotton Mills, pedaled his
          bicycle around the mill village in West Durham in the evenings, enforcing
          a 10 P.M. "lights-out" rule. For the workers he referred to as "my people,"
          Erwin built a huge auditorium where they attended concerts and plays,
          movies and flower shows. Later he added a swimming pool, tennis courts,
          and even a small zoo.
        <p>Erwin's beneficence, however, did not silence the rising critics of
          a system that traded informal "favors" for complete submission to the
          owner's authority. "His mill villages are better than most other companies,"
          admitted one union leader, "but he preaches baths, swimming pools, and
          that kind of thing and then won't pay a wage that is anything near even
          a living wage." </p>
