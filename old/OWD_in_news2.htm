        <p><font size="2">If you'd just happened upon a recent concert at Duke
          you might have thought you were witnessing magic. Jonathan Bagg
          (violist 
          of the Ciompi Quartet) and his family were celebrating his and his
          wife  Susie's 20th wedding anniversary by playing an awesome program
          of classical 
          music.... We've gotten to share in watching them grow as people, and
          musicians, since the kids were tiny. Which is why it was just so
          intensely 
          moving to see them there, at a high point in the arc of their family's
          life cycle, in all their glory. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2">At dusk Sunday, many neighborhoods across the city
          will  join in the annual act of lighting up the dark December sky
          with luminarias. 
          Neighbors will celebrate Christmas together... In Old West Durham,
          neighbors  will celebrate at the &quot;old liquor house&quot; on
          Virgie Street.  Two doors opened into the house's back yard. One
          was prominent and led 
          nowhere, but another smaller, hidden door led to a room with locked,
          floor-to-ceiling cabinets filled with neighbors' spirits... Sunday,
          
          however, the house will be a place for neighbors to come and celebrate.
          And they also plan to bring canned goods, which they will donate
          to 
          a local group to be chosen Sunday.</font><FONT SIZE=5><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="Navy"><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT SIZE = 2><FONT COLOR=Black><FONT SIZE = 2> </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

          close watch, 
          Tuesday night was far from an average night at the Regulator Bookshop
          in Durham. Jimmy Carter was in town.. Nearly 2,000 people were estimated
          
          to be at the Ninth Street bookstore, which reported selling more than
          2,500 copies of &quot;The Hornet's Nest,&quot; Carter's latest book.
          Sales were so brisk that the store sold out of all of Carter's
          books. </font></p>

          West  Durham Neighborhood Association for their help in planting
          these permaculture 
          gardens. Our school grounds look better than ever, and we have these

          driven by employees or customers of Dogstar and other businesses located 
          in Durham's Ninth Street district. With leased parking in the vicinity

          sorely like to have... The city and commercial interests must work together 
          to provide both ample parking and user-friendly enforcement. The issue 
          isn't cars, its dollars. The more dollars for Ninth Street, the better 
          for everybody. </font></p>

          caused by such giant houses with big backyards is chewing up the existing 
          green space.... Instead of sprawling suburbs that reduce family time 
          to small talk in the SUV, cities would do well to steer their growth 
          toward densely populated communities that encourage relationships among 
          neighbors.</font></p>

          all the students who live in the many neighborhoods in the Powe attendance 
          (Walltown, West End, Crest Street, Old West Durham and Watts Hospital-Hillandale).

        <p><font size="2">During last night's Duke-Durham forum, Old West Durham 
          president John Schelp attempted to entice students to explore Durham's 
          history and neighborhoods by handing out papers asking questions like, 
          &quot;Where did Richard Nixon live as a Duke Law student?&quot; and 
          &quot;Where did Elvis go to lose weight?&quot; The answers are found 
          on a self-guided tour of the East Campus area, which can be found on 
          the Old West Durham's Web site... Also mentioned was the &quot;group 
          hug moment&quot; that resulted from a long process in which Duke officials 
          and 12 local neighborhoods worked together to achieve support for rezoning 
          1400 acres on Duke's campus to create a new university-college district.</font></p>

          neighborhood representatives have worked out zoning proposal amendments 
          that should preserve an attractive campus perimeter for years to come... 
          One issue yet to be resolved is a possible university plan to replace 
          Duke's two-story apartments complex on Central Campus with a development 
          that might include a limited number of retail shops. Initially the university 
          asked for the ordinance to allow unlimited retail uses that would not 
          be restricted to students. After Old West Durham and Watts-Hillandale 
          leaders (representing the 12 Duke-Durham partnership neighborhoods) 
          expressed concerns that such a development could hurt nearby businesses 
          on Ninth Street, the university decided to remove Central Campus from 
          the university zoning district.</font></p>

          in two years. The new East residence hall will be<br>
          constructed in between Randolph Dormitory and Broad<br>

          that runs from the all-freshmen campus toward Ninth<br>

          owned by Erwin Square Limited Partnership. "It&acute;s an important 
          development for the neighborhood because it&acute;s in the middle of 
          the neighborhood. It&acute;s in the middle of the nationally registered

          growth" concept and "delighted" with some of the historical design features. 
          But they also were concerned about how stormwater would be handled and 
          how much open space will eventually remain on the entire Erwin Square 
          site, he said. Neighborhood representatives would continue working with 
          the developer as details become available. "We&acute;re interested in

          proposal has elicited considerable interest from neighborhood associations, 
          which are a powerful force in Durham land use decisions, in part because 
          of the site's proximity to a possible light-rail station near Ninth

          back into a city's core, which spurs revitalization. Like many older 
          cities whose economic and tax-base fortunes were hurt by urban sprawl, 
          Durham would benefit from the return of residents and development to 
          town. The other obvious value of new housing plunked down in the middle 
          of Durham is shorter commutes, instead of long ones from the suburbs 
          to job centers at Research Triangle Park and Duke University and to 
          shopping at Northgate Mall and Brightleaf Square. Such density should 
          fit into existing neighborhoods, and developers seem to have worked 
          toward that end. Importantly, the project would be built near a station 
          of the proposed Triangle Transit Authority regional rail line. The first 
          stage of the rail system will connect Durham and Raleigh. Dense housing 
          around the stations would maximize the rail's effect for convenience 
          and removing cars from Triangle roads. </font></p>

          From the beginning, the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association has 
          been a strong proponent of regional rail in general and of a Ninth Street 
          station in particular... The Ninth Street shopping district is one of 
          the most bustling in Durham, attracting customers from throughout the 
          Triangle. With the planned expansion of Erwin Square and the Duke Medical 
          Center research complex along Erwin Road, even more businesses and residents 
          will be reached via the Ninth Street location -- creating jobs, increasing 
          ridership and boosting Durham's tax base. </font></font></p>

          ways to while away those magical summer nights in the Triangle... Why 
          limit yourself to a single haunt when you can hit Ninth Street in Durham 
          and enjoy all the area has to offer? That's what Durham resident and 
          Ninth Street proponent David McKnight likes to do. With restaurant, 
          bar and cafe owners setting tables out on the sidewalk for summer revelers, 
          "We have porches and patios all the way from Elmo's Diner to Wellspring," 
          said McKnight, a musician who performs in the area. Ninth Street is 
          also a great place to browse, meet up with friends, have a meal and 
          enjoy live music, he said.</font></p>

          back in 1999 when Gaile Welker of Greensboro saw an Internet story about 
          the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association's cleanup of a cemetery 
          and sent an e-mail message to the group's president to ask whether Fuller's 
          grave had been found... Together, the "group of five strangers" persuaded 
          city leaders to proclaim today "Blind Boy Fuller Day," erect the marker 
          on the American Tobacco Trail near his grave and got the state to agree 
          to put up another marker later this summer on Fayetteville Street.</font></p>

                                          of those two words, one needs to turn back the clock half a century, 
                                          to the days of bobby socks, poodle skirts, big cars, cheap gas, and 
                                          early rock 'n roll. When Durham still was the city of tobacco, the Blue 
                                          Light Restaurant was one of the hottest spots in town for high school 
                                          kids and Duke University students... the whole Ninth Street area was 
                                          much different in the early days of the Blue Light.</font>

                travelers gathered on Hillsborough Road to sell tobacco and dabble in 
                vices at local brothels. A local newspaper described a typical scene 
                one day in 1871: A man and woman had run a foot race for a quart of 
                liquor--stark naked. When Erwin Cotton Mills started up at the turn 
                of the century, folks' behavior toned down as workers planted roots, 
                building homes and raising families... <a href = "indy.htm">http://www.owdna.org/indy.htm</a>

                              matriculating from suburban New York, I wasn't too thrilled about going 
                              to school in what I first perceived to be a sleepy Southern city. But, 
                              as I near the end of my four years here, I can truly say that I love 
                              Durham. One doesn't instantly take a liking to this city. Like a favorite 
                              pair of blue jeans that mold to your butt after a couple of years, Durham 
                              grows on you... but you have to be willing to give it a chance (and 
                              to let Durham mold you as well). Durham is a bit like your quirky, misunderstood 
                              Uncle Larry who always manages to do something clearly inappropriate 
                              at family gatherings, but is, underneath it all, way more interesting 
                              than anyone else in your family. Chapel Hill, on the other hand, is 
                              like your young rich Uncle Chad who everyone likes because he has impeccable 
                              style and lends people money, but who is really kind of a prick. I mean,

                              Starbucks -- but a glorified mall? ... There are two Irish pubs located

                                      their customers were coming there for things that money can't buy. McDonald 
                                      was brought up in the drugstore. His father opened in 1914 on Main Street. 
                                      He moved to Ninth Street in 1916 in a two-story wooden building. He 
                                      moved in this location in 1922. McDonald went to school at E.K. Powe, 
                                      two blocks down the street here. When McDonald was big enough, instead 
                                      of walking home, he'd walk down to the drugstore. He'd sit over in the

                                      basically involved with Erwin Mills, which made sheets and pillow cases. 
                                      The small stores up and down Ninth Street provided for the needs mostly 
                                      of the people that worked in Erwin Mills. You had a couple little barber

                                Bull City. Previously known as Pin Hook, the area was actually settled 
                                before Durham itself. Stretching from Broad Street west to Hillandale 
                                Road and from the railroad tracks north to Englewood Avenue, much of 
                                the neighborhood is a collection of quiet, tree-lined streets... </font>

          awards for conservation of buildings ranging from the modest to the 
          grand. There's the Old Adams Street Neighborhood Grocery, for instance. 
          The small frame building, erected in 1911 at Alabama and Knox streets 
          in West Durham, was used by the Erlinger family to sell vegetables and 
          soft drinks in the 1960s. </font>

          Almost from the beginning, Duke University has seemed to stand apart 
          from the community it calls home. Its mission, it said, was to educate, 
          not to solve the ills of Durham. But in a change of heart -- and policy 
          -- the city's largest and most prestigious employer will announce this 
          week a campaign to form a partnership with 12 surrounding neighborhoods 
          and seven schools. In doing so, Duke hopes to signal the start of a 
          new relationship with the community -- and change its image as the rich, 
          uncaring neighbor... </font>

          council member Floyd McKissick Jr. said after Duke officials made the 
          first public presentation of their ambitious plan at the council's work 
          session. "Duke has a reputation of being a very exclusive enclave," 
          McKissick added. "People there have little interaction with the city 
                                                              of Durham." Over the past year, Duke has undertaken an effort to make
