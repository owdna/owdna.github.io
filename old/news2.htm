        </p>
        <p> <font size="2">DURHAM -- The Library of Congress has a special place 
          for the Old West Durham neighborhood: an acid-free box. &nbsp; The historic 
          neighborhood near Duke University started as a pit stop for travelers 
          even before Durham was established in the 1850s. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Narrative and photographs illustrating its history 
          make up one of about 1,300 entries in the Library of Congress' Local 
          Legacies Project, which celebrates the library's bicentennial by documenting 
          and preserving slices of life from communities across the country. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> The N.C. State Fair and the American Dance Festival 
          are also among the 44 local legacies from North Carolina, and those 
          who submitted entries are invited to a reception Tuesday at the Library 
          of Congress. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> John Schelp, president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood 
          Association, who also works at the National Institute of Environmental 
          Health Sciences, said he plans to be there. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">&quot;I love history. I'm a history buff,&quot; he 
          said of the work, which started about a year ago, to put the neighborhood's 
          history up on the Internet. &quot;It started small.&quot; </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Neighborhood residents worked with librarians, consulted 
          history books and talked to residents to reconstruct the tale of how 
          the neighborhood started out as &quot;Pin Hook,&quot; a settlement that 
          included &quot;a lodging house, camping grove, brothels, grog shops, 
          and a well for drinking water for passing travelers,&quot; the document 
          says. In the early 1890s, the Erwin Cotton Mills went up, transforming 
          the area into a mill village. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> E.K. Powe III, 78, whose grandfather was the first 
          general manager of the mill, grew up in Old West Durham, back when that 
          area was considered &quot;the country,&quot; he said. He recalled the 
          summer of 1936, when he helped carpenters re-roof and repair some of 
          the 450 mill houses. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">&quot;They were nice houses,&quot; he said. &quot;They 
          were small. They all had front porches. Everybody had a front porch 
          back then.&quot; </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> He lived on Swift Avenue and remembers the cherry, 
          pear and apple trees on his family's three acres of land. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">&quot;We kids would climb up on the grape arbor and 
          eat the grapes around August or September,&quot; he said. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Sometimes children would hang out at Erwin Auditorium, 
          which had a soda shop, swimming pool, tennis court and a small zoo. 
          </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">&quot;Most people knew everybody,&quot; he said. &quot;It 
          has changed a lot.&quot; </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Schelp said the story got the attention of U.S. Rep. 
          David Price, who nominated the neighborhood project as a local legacy. 
          &nbsp; Evie McCleaf, Local Legacies project liaison, said the project 
          has been &quot;successful beyond our control.&quot; It's billed as an 
          unprecedented, nationwide volunteer effort to document the United States' 
          grass-roots heritage. &nbsp; Entries had to be nominated by congressional 
          offices, but other than that, there was no selection process. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2">&quot;We were asking for representations of unique 
          cultural events and the historical culture of small communities across 
          the nation, trying to get a glimpse of local communities at the turn 
          of the century,&quot; McCleaf said. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> Other entries include information about an annual powwow 
          in Denver, the life cycle of salmon in Washington and the National Polka 
          Festival in Texas. </font> 
        <p><font size="2"> The entries will be stored in acid-free boxes in the 
          Archive of American Folk Culture. </font>

        <P><font size="2"> Although the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association 
          [<a href="index.htm">http://www.owdna.org</a>] hand delivers a newsletter 
          to residents twice a year, the prospect of delivering news and information 
          much more quickly — and in a cost-efficient way—meant taking advantage 
          of the Internet, according to Webmaster Pamela Spaulding. </font> 
        <P> 
        <P><font size="2"> The up-and-coming, diverse neighborhood is a designated 
          National Registry Historic District that offers charm, history, and 
          a variety of unique shops and acclaimed restaurants. Located near Duke 
          University and home to the city's oldest firehouse and a collection 
          of intact turn-of-the- century mill houses, Old West Durham prides itself 
          as a neighborhood that offers "diversity, harmony, and community." </font> 
        <P> 
        <P> <font size="2"><b>Web Site Helps Association Achieve Goals</b> </font> 
        <P><font size="2"> The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association was established 
          in 1995, and in November of 1998, OWDNA brought its vision to the Web. 
          By locating free online resources and contributions of time from board 
          and association members, the site grew quickly and took on a life of 
          its own. </font> 
        <P> 
        <P><font size="2"> The site now has extensive neighborhood history (displaying 
          turn-of-the-century photos of the area from Duke University's Special 
          Collections Library), links to city services, area cultural sites and 
          news about issues that OWDNA is working on to improve the quality of 
          life for its residents. </font> 
        <P> 
        <P><font size="2"> The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association web site 
          was designed to use the full capabilities of the Internet to educate 
          residents visitors to the site about our neighborhood's rich history 
          and positive future; be a communications tool to work with residents, 
          local government, businesses and developers in a positive way to encourage 
          growth that will complement and preserve the neighborhood's character 
          as we move into the 21st century; and foster a sense of community among 
          residents by showing them the effect that active participation in neighborhood 
          concerns can have. </font> 
        <P> 
        <P> <font size="2">"Our goals are the same today," says Ms. Spaulding. 
          </font> 
        <P> 
        <P><font size="2"> Rich content, a professional appearance, and links 
          to a variety of community resources combine to make this laudable neighborhood 
          web site, which has embraced the power of the Internet to communicate 
          with residents and visitors alike. Particularly notable are the pictorial 
          guide to the neighborhood's history — which allows online visitors to 
          travel back in time — and the Citizen Resources guide, which includes 
          contact information for community action groups, citizen questions or 
          concerns, and links. The site is also an effective way for the Association 
          to communicate its positions on issues such as traffic, green space, 
          and regional rail — and to publicize its events, activities, and other 
          news. </font> 
        <P> 
        <P><font size="2"> Receiving over 3,000 hits to date, the site has been 
          covered in local media and commended by the Durham Mayor Nick Tennyson 
          for its service to the community. </font> 
        <P> 
        <P> <font size="2">"Because OWDNA is only four years old, it had to build 
          awareness among Durham realtors, city officials and even residents, 
          some of whom did not even realize that the area had a defined neighborhood 
          designation. Often when houses went up for sale, realtors would list 
          them as 'Watts-Hillandale area' (a neighboring community, with a well-established 
          organization). As a result of work by members and the visibility of 
          Old West Durham via the web site, realtors have started to publish properties 
          as being located in 'Old West Durham'." </font> 
        <P> 
        <P><font size="2"> Compared to surrounding established neighborhood association 
          web sites, OWDNA's has quickly become the most comprehensive. This increased 
          visibility has garnered attention by city officials and entities and 
          has enabled the association to have a greater impact on traffic calming, 
          zoning and development issues that directly affect the community. Residents 
          have been able to participate more fully in the association by using 
          email and the web site to generate ideas and voice concerns that can 
          be acted upon without having to attend the monthly meetings, building 
          a "virtual membership" that extends the capabilities of our neighbors. 
          </font> 
        <P> 
        <P> <font size="2"><b>More Enhancements on the Horizon </b> </font> 
        <P> <font size="2">"One of the early ideas that we would love to incorporate 
          into this project would be the addition of audio and video clips of 
          interviews with long-time residents of Old West Durham to the web site. 
          These seniors have colorful personal histories to tell about the neighborhood 
          that are invaluable in bringing the past to life. </font> 
        <P> 
        <P><font size="2"> Another ambitious goal would be to have an online membership 
          database that could be accessible and editable (via password access) 
          by board members by web browser. It would be wonderful if people could 
          join the association via the web and purchase neighborhood association 
          merchandise (T-shirts, bumper stickers, virtual yard sales, etc.) and 
          help make OWDNA grow so that we could undertake more community projects."<br>

          of each neighborhood (including E.K. Powe III and Miss Elizabeth Wilson 
          who taught many years at E.K. Powe starting in 1949). Through this experience, 
          the children learned about good citizenship, geography, history, political 
          science, and important community landmarks and assets. The children 
          wrote about what they learned and discussed issues such as fairness, 
          honesty, hard work and responsibility. They also learned how to write

          Dickson family for working closely with the neighborhood association 
          on its plans. We offered a number of suggestions that are reflected 
          in the submitted plans (including red brick exterior instead of stucco 
          -- to reflect the history of surrounding Erwin Mills and EK Powe Elementary). 
          We are very excited about the planned renovation of this block of Ninth 
          Street which has stood vacant for too long. We are absolutely delighted 
          that the new buildings will serve as a bridge between the Ninth Street 
          shops and the residential areas of Old West Durham.</font> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> This is a plan 
          for which we should all feel very proud. The City and the Dickson's 
          are to be commended for working with the community on a dream that will 
          be a shot in the arm for the neighborhood and for all of Durham. </font>

          BP design but only bigger). Instead, the owner has agreed to renovate

          Blacknall, Bull City Market, Ninth Street Merchants Association and 
          the City to have a four-way stop sign installed at busy Perry and Iredell. 
          OWDNA also supported a resident-initiated effort for a four-way stop 
          sign placed at Rosehill and Knox. Working with Watts-Hillandale and 
          the City, a four-way stop sign was placed at Georgia and Englewood. 
          This measure was deemed more desirable by OWDNA than blocking off Georgia 
          -- which would have resulted in higher traffic levels in Old West Durham. 
          Finally, responding to resident concerns about pedestrian safety near 
          the ABC store, OWDNA succeeded in getting the City to install a four-way

        <p><font size="2"><i>by John Schelp</i> </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It's hard to believe that it was wasn't too long ago 
          that the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association received the Independent 
          Weekly's 1998 Citizen Award for "tireless dedication to making our community 
          a better place to live." And, it's been one heck of a year. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We're making excellent progress in creating an urban 
          green space on Green Street near Ninth (including a good meeting with 
          the mayor and mayor pro-tem at the site), adding a new sidewalk connecting 
          Edith Street with Ninth -- alongside E.K. Powe Elementary School (budgeted 
          by City), adding a new community bulletin board (budgeted by the City), 
          and getting a traffic circle at one of our busiest residential intersections 
          (budgeted by City). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In addition, the OWDNA received a $2,000 Partners Against 
          Crime grant to help the association build community (with T-shirts and 
          OWDNA bumper stickers) and provide items for residents to enhance home 
          security (including flood lights and window screws). Your association 
          also had 75 new street lights installed along neighborhood streets and 
          our award-winning website has received national acclaim. We hosted Congressman 
          David Price for a walking tour of Old West Durham and succeeded in getting 
          most local real estate agencies to list neighborhood properties as being 
          in "Old West Durham." The association also sponsored a board member 
          to take a planning and zoning class at Duke, organized two clean-ups 
          at the site of our proposed urban greenspace across from EK Powe, and 
          kept a watchful eye on local plans for regional rail and the future 
          development of Erwin Square. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We are also working on a broad traffic calming plan 
          for neighborhood streets, sponsored an OWDNA booth at the first annual 
          InterNeighborhood Council summit, and have updated our neighborhood 
          membership directory. Getting great input from long-time residents, 
          OWDNA is building a detailed neighborhood history of this National Historic 
          District and we've started placing ads in our newsletter – eliminating 
          our association's biggest expense.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> On the very day Hurricane Floyd struck, OWDNA residents 
          gathered to help clear downed trees on Carolina Avenue and on Green 
          Street. In an effort to build community, we recently celebrated Old 
          West Durham Day (and the anniversary of our new neighborhood sign across 
          from Barnes Supply). With Hurricane Gert raining outside, more than 
          twenty-five neighbors gathered to break bread and share stories at Cosmic 
          Cantina. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The success stories shared here are the result of an 
          outstanding effort by OWDNA board members and other dedicated residents 
          working together to move this great neighborhood forward. Please join 
          us as we continue the journey. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">All OWD residents are encouraged to attend and participate 
          in our board meeting/potlucks that take place at 7:00 PM on the last 
          Thursday of each month (email <a href="mailto:john@owdna.org">john@owdna.org</a>

          the university is moving more offices into the old Erwin Mills building

          we're pleased to join with a number of other Duke departments in sharing 
          this remarkable space." said Paula Gilbert, Assistant Dean and Director 
          of Duke Continuing Education and Summer Session. The former textile 
          mill building, similar in architectural style to Brightleaf Square, 
          will also house a district police station jointly staffed by the Duke 
          Police and Durham Public Safety to provide security for the entire neighborhood. 
          Erwin Mill will also be the home to the Office of the Director of Community
