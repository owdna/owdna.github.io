        <p> </p>
        <p>by W.S Lockhart (The Trinity Archive, 1906) 
        <p>The student of history has long ago learned that the situation of a 
          country and the nature of the soil are large factors in determining 
          the character of a people. This is especially true of the section in 
          which Durham is situated. The city is built on a low ridge which serves 
          as a watershed between the Eno and the Neuse on the north, and New Hope 
          creek, which is a tributary of the Cape Fear, on the south. As might 
          be expected the soil is poor and unsuited to the cultivation of most 
          crops that a pioneer would be likely to raise. So a student is likely 
          to conclude that in the early settlement of the country this section 
          would not be taken up by the first settlers. The more fertile tracts 
          along the New Hope on the south and the Eno and Neuse on the west and 
          north attracted the new home-seekers and the land lying between them 
          was for some time left vacant. Later on, when the settlements became 
          more thickly populated, the shiftless were pushed out of the fertile 
          acres and came into this poor section of country and built themselves 
          homes. As all know, the shiftless and poor are liable to give way to 
          the less refined forms of vice and we find the people of this section 
          no exception to the rule. Also it is likely that the vicious element 
          from adjacent sections drifted into such places as this, being spurned 
          by the more wealthy communities. As proof of the poverty of these people 
          one only has to drive out along the country roads in any direction from 
          Durham. He will have to go almost a dozen miles before he finds a house 
          of any consequence that was built before the Civil War. </p>
        <p>The foregoing, I think, accounts largely for the straitened condition 
          and low morality of a large number of the old inhabitants of this section, 
          for almost any old citizen can, if he chooses, tell you interesting 
          tales concerning the exploits of certain characters who used to live 
          here. These people generally lived in little communities, each of which 
          had a distinctive name. One of these places which was in what is now 
          the suburbs of the city of Durham was called Pinhook. </p>
        <p><font size="+2"><img src="../graphics/history/ermill1.jpg" width=425 height=263 border=1 align=bottom></font><font size="2" color="Navy"><br>
          Pinhook stood about where the clump of trees just north of the railroad 
          tracks is shown in this photo. Today, the Erwin Square tower casts its 
          shadow across the site of the old settlement.</font></p>
        <p>Pinhook was near the place where the West Durham Cotton Mill has been 
          erected. The house stood about a hundred yards southwest of the southwest 
          corner of the mill. Some questionable characters kept a resort there, 
          and near by there was a grog shop. Why the place was called Pinhook 
          is not known, but it certainly went by I that name for a number of years 
          before the Civil War. </p>
        <p>Near this place was a camping ground where wagoners stopped on their 
          way to Raleigh and other eastern towns before the time of railroads. 
          The campers got water from the Pinhook well and made use of the grove 
          near by, where they tied their horses and were protected somewhat by 
          the trees from the weather. It is said that a man, who later was a citizen 
          of Durham and became quite rich, was a pale, sallow-looking boy at the 
          time Pinhook was experiencing its balmiest days. He carried watermelons 
          out to the old camp ground, piled them up in the fence corners, and 
          sold them to the wagoners who doubtless found them refreshing after 
          their long draughts of fiery corn liquor which they bought from the 
          Pinhook grog shop. In this way he started a fortune which became quite 
          considerable before his death. </p>
        <p>Besides being a favorite stopping-place for the wagoners, Pinhook was 
          known for miles around. Its fame spread as far as twelve or fifteen 
          miles northwest, as may to this day be learned from the old inhabitants 
          of the country communities, and even the students of the University 
          at Chapel Hill had the habit of coming over when they wished to go off 
          on a lark. It was known as a place of brawls and rough-and-tumble fights, 
          drinking, gambling and other forms of amusement, where the natives and 
          visitors met to have a rough, roaring, and to them, glorious time.</p>
        <p>Pinhook was the best known of a number of houses of rather shady reputation 
          around West Durham and a little west of it. The section from this settlement 
          as far east as the wye near East Durham was, in the language of a citizen 
          of Durham, "a roaring old place" before and for a while after the war. 
          Down near the wye, a man named Vickers kept a liquor shop, and just 
          west of him one William Pratt, who was quite a wealthy man for this 
          time, also dispensed "the universal panacea." It may be added that at 
          various times liquor was sold at several other places in what is now 
          the city of Durham. </p>
        <p>An amusing incident is told of an old man of the neighborhood, now 
          many years dead, who, not to mention a rather ordinary cognomen, gloried 
          in the praenomen, "Wash." He was a notorious rowdy, a man who drank 
          and was known far and wide for his boisterous carousing. When the North 
          Carolina Railroad was in process of construction, it was announced that 
          on a certain day a train would approach within a few miles of the place 
          where Durham is now situated. Many of the people of the community collected 
          at the appointed time to see the new wonder. Among these were the aforementioned 
          "Wash" and his wife. Like almost all trains, ancient and modern, this 
          train was late and after waiting some time "Wash" announced that he 
          was thirsty. So with much fussing and in spite of the protestations 
          of his wife he declared that he was going to Vickers's tavern to get 
          him some liquor. The good lady objected in a most strenuous manner, 
          urging the great danger from the expected train, but "Wash" was obdurate. 
          He, therefore, secured a bushel of corn, a gallon jug and a blind horse 
          and set out. It was not more than a mile to the tavern and it so happened 
          that the ever watchful Mrs. "Wash" spied the train approaching from 
          one direction and her husband from the other at the same time. Screaming 
          at the top of her voice and with outstretched arms she ran to meet her 
          beloved spouse. Before she reached him the train passed and the blind 
          horse, frightened by the unusual noise, threw the doughty tippler and 
          broke his jug. Immediately Mrs. "Wash's" fear was turned into joy and 
          she ran back to her friends, clapping her hands and shouting: "Glory 
          to God! 'Wash' is safe and his jug of liquor's broke!"</p>
        <p>With the growth of the city of Durham these old inhabitants learned 
          new ways and many of their descendents are now regarded as the city's 
          most valuable citizens. Indeed, with new conditions, the old have almost 
          been forgotten and it will be only a few years till you cannot find 
          a man who ever heard of Pinhook. Thus the old is being continually swallowed 
          up by the new. </p>
