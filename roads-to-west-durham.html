          Mills stood at the cross roads: The old Erwin Road approached from Chapel 
          Hill and crossed old NC 10 where the railroad bridge crosses Ninth Street 
          -- near the street car terminus on West Main.</font></p>
        <p>NC 10 (Central Highway) was the first highway to cross the state.
          Its route followed the ridge between the Neuse River and Cape Fear
          River basins (from Beaufort to Murphy). Folks said you could walk along
          NC 10 and never get your feet wet. In Durham, NC 10 followed West Main,
          turned up Ninth Street and went out Hillsboro Road -- towards other
        cotton mills in Hillsborough, Haw River, and Salisbury. </p>
        <p>When the US started designating national highways in 1927, the &quot;magnificent
          state route number 10&quot; became US 70. Sections of NC 10 can still
        be found in western Durham County (near Route 751 and Duke Forest).</p>

          it ended at Erwin Mills). John and his wife, Eula, lived at 402 Case 
          Street (the only house still standing on Case Street, next to Duke School 
          for Children).</p>
        <p>"We would watch the cars go up and down Erwin Road. This was great 
          for me at 13. These cars were mainly on their way to "the Blue Light" 
          on Erwin Road. This was a popular hang out for boys! I was certainly 
          in heaven." -Holly Marlow Hall (grew up in Old West Durham)</p>

          To diversify its tobacco holdings, the Duke family invested in the Erwin 
          Cotton Mills -- near its tobacco factories, also on West Main Street. 
          Like its other operations, the Duke's built their mills near the rail 
          road tracks.</p>

          Elder and Elba streets. Times have changed.</p>

        <p>&quot;They had turned away from the centre of the dreary tobacco town. 
          For a quarter of an hour they had walked briskly through drab autumnal 
          streets, descending finally a long rutted hill that led them, past a 
          thinning squalor of cheap houses, almost to the outskirts. It was three 
          weeks before Christmas: the foggy air was full if chill menace. There 
          was a brooding quietness, broken by far small sounds. They turned into 
          a sordid little road, unpaved, littered on both sides... it was a road 
          of rickets."<br>

          <strong>Did you know?</strong> Chapel Hill's Carolina Inn opened in<br>
          1924 and was donated to the University in 1935 by<br>
          Erwin Mills. Nearby, the Chapel of the Cross was the<br>
          gift of William A. Erwin, first manager of the mills<br>
          on Ninth Street.<br>

        <p>In the 1950s, the bridges along old NC 10 (between Hillsborough and 
          NC 751) were the original, one-lane "Cameron Morrison" models of the 
          early 1920s. Historian David Southern recalls thrilling trips down that 
          road with its hairpin turns, railroad trestles, and narrow bridge over 
          Stone's Creek. </p>

              <p>On turning axle creaks the year, the old machinery <br>
                Of lithographed and gilded calendars the milkman <br>
                Brings, the grocer sends: their art and compliments <br>
                To grace the home throughout the year where spring <br>
                And summers are but numbers now when on the wall <br>
                The people hang chronologies of shifting shuttles, reels<br>
                Unwinding in the mills...</p>
              <p>And they shall hear each day <br>
                The trains and whistles, engines shifting cars <br>
                Inside the factory yard, and know these link them surely<br>
                To worlds they do not know...</p>
              <p>The trees shall bear again <br>
                The bursting bud, the greening leaf; the roads <br>
                Shall dry, bear dust again, and men shall not be cold</p>
              <p>On U.S. Seventy, how many cars shall pass, and trucks <br>
                Shall toil up little grades, with whining gears before <br>
                The summer comes, how many miles of cloth shall leave <br>
                The mills to prove their lives are repetitious and enslaved? <br>
                The census takers come, and make the world statistical, <br>
                But do not change it: here is no revolt but death, <br>
                And even that is ineffectual; the cheap coffin borne <br>
                In the crawling hearse, followed by dirty ancient cars <br>
                Is witless proof, and standard gravestones add the sin <br>
                Of final ugliness. <br>
                Here thought has lost its sting, <br>
                And song is standardized. <br>
                Yet ineluctable as noise, <br>
                Tall leafing trees will hide the houses in the spring.</p></td>
