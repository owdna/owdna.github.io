        <P>No fewer than nine congregations were organized in West Durham for 
          the workers at Erwin Mills. The Methodists started meeting in 1893 at 
          different cottages across the new mill village and eventually built 
          a frame church in 1896 at Ninth and Main (where the BP gas station now 
          stands).</P>
        <P>The Baptists set up shop on Ninth Street in 1894. Another Baptist group 
          established West Durham Baptist on Ferrell Street (near Swift Avenue 
          in Brookstown).</P>
        <P>Also in 1894, William Erwin (mill manager and devout Episcopalian) 
          started teaching Sunday school on the second floor of the company store 
          and post office on Ninth Street (later becoming St. Joseph's). The Prebyterians 
          organized in a small frame building on Bolton Street in 1905, near present-day 
          Erwin Square (later becoming Blacknall). </P>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1911, the Pentecostal's 
          began in a small mill house on Gin Street (behind the present-day Pizza 
          Palace). In 1937, the West Durham Church of God was organized on Case 
          Street in Brookstown (near present-day Duke School for Children). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pilgrim Holiness 
          Church held services in an old log cabin on Hale Street, near Hillsborough 
          Road. The church burned down around 1980 (today a beauty salon occupies 
          the site). After meeting in homes, brush arbors, tents, store buildings 
          and halls, West Durham Wesleyan Church was built in 1915 at Ninth and 
          West Knox (across from what is today the Magnolia Grill). </font> </p>

          West Durham Baptist was organized in 1894 in a wood church building 
          on Ninth Street. A tornado destroyed the building in June of 1897 and 
          a second church (see drawing) was built on Alexander Avenue, near the 
          present-day Duke police station. </font></p>

          Church of God was organized in 1937 on Monkey Bottom's Case Street in 
          a small plank church of rough-cut pine. From the beginning, it was difficult 
          to build membership in a town dominated by Baptists and Methodists. 
          The "new" West Durham Church of God was built in 1947 at the corner 
          of Hillsborough and Knox. Above is a photo of the church on Easter Sunday 
          in 1950. Today, an ABC store stands on the <a href="history9.htm#abc">site</a>.

        <p><font size="2">In 1893, Mr. Reuben Hibberd, a local florist and lay 
          preacher, began holding cottage prayer meetings and "Sunday Sings" in 
          mill houses around the Erwin Mill village. If the host family didn't 
          have an organ, the Hibberd's would bring a small portable organ.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">When the mill houses became too small to hold everyone, 
          the Sunday School was moved to a grandstand in the baseball park on 
          Broad Street (near present-day East Campus). It was during an 1894 revival 
          in the grandstand that the West Durham Methodist Church was chartered.

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two years later, 
          Benjamin Duke deeded land at the corner of Ninth and West Main for a 
          small chapel (where the BP gas station now stands). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="/old/graphics/history/c036.jpg" width="390" height="279"><br>

          As membership grew to 600, Sunday School classes had to be separated 
          by green curtains. The congregation moved to its current location in 
          1927 and, as the church extended its reach beyond West Durham, changed 
          it name to Asbury Methodist in 1944. </font></p>

          a neighborhood fish market. In 1934, the congregation built a new log 
          church at 805 Hale. The church was severely damaged by fire in 1978. 
          Members then gathered at Howerton-Bryan funeral chapel and later First 
          Wesleyan on Ninth Street. The new owners built the red brick beauty

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the summer of 
          1907, a group of ministers and workers conducted a tent revival on Broad 
          Street. Among the workers that day was Wesleyan minister Rev. Shuber 
          Williams who followed up the meeting with services in different homes 
          for the benefit of new converts to the Wesleyan faith. On January 10, 
          1908, thirty charter members organized the West Durham Wesleyan Church 
          at the Hillsboro Road home of JE Conway (near Ninth Street).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The new church 
          worshiped where it could; in homes, brush arbors, tents, store buildings 
          and halls. In 1915, the congregation erected a small frame church and 
          belfry at 922 Ninth Street (across from what is now the Magnolia Grill). 
          In 1935, the sanctuary was lengthened 30 feet. Twenty years later, a 
          two-story education wing was added in the back (towards Iredell).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1979, the church 
          merged with another Wesleyan congregation, welcomed new members from 
          the fire-damaged Pilgrim Holiness Church on Hale Street, and moved to 
          a new location on Cole Mill Road. Today, the Dayspring Fellowship worships 
          in the original church on Ninth Street. </font></p>
