          End -- near present-day George's Garage (below). Loom Fixers had better 
          pay than Weavers. Moore is standing in front of a Draper Loom (which 
          was replaced by a modern Sulzer Weaving Machine). In a nod to progress, 
          folks stopped calling these "Looms" and started calling them "Weaving 
          Machines."</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bobby Jackson, 
          Jr. recalls that his union (Local 257) set up shop in a small wood building 
          at Rosehill and Hillsborough (today, the back of West Durham Tire). 
          During a short-lived strike, the union handed out a small amount of 
          food items to the striking workers once a week -- at the end of Rosehill 
          Avenue. </font> </p>
        <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This was around 
          1950 because my Mother remembers that she was expecting my oldest sister 
          during this time," Jackson said. "My Grandfather on my Mother's side 
          ran a Cafe there years before when my Mother was just a teenage girl. 
          His name was Buck Carden." </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary Harris "Mother" 
          Jones (1836-1930) was a union organizer who was denounced in the U.S. 
          Senate as the grandmother of all agitators. In 1903, Mother Jones organized 
          a march of striking children from the textile mills of Kensington, Pennsylvania, 
          to petition President Theodore Roosevelt. He refused to see them, but 
          the march helped to raise national awareness of the plight of child 
          workers.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Working conditions 
          during the Great Depression brought relations between mill workers and 
          management to a boiling point. In September 1934, tens of thousands 
          of </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">textile 
          workers throughout the South walked off the job protesting conditions 
          at the mills and in company-controlled mill villages. According to the 
          News &amp; Observer, hundreds of striking Erwin Mills workers rallied 
          at the Carolina Theatre, marched down Main Street and enjoyed widespread 
          community support.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The General Textile 
          Strike of 1934 ended three weeks later with some 20 workers dead from 
          strike-related violence, others sitting in internment camps and little 
          progress for the "lintheads," the pejorative term for cotton mill workers. 
          Years later, the memory of the strike (considered by historians the 
          largest labor revolt in Southern history) has faded along with the mill 
          villages it helped eliminate. In a part of the country where "union" 
          often has the status of a four-letter word, the strike showed that Southern 
          workers can organize for change even during the Great Depression and 
          amid the constraints of having the mill as employer, landlord and store 
          owner. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The textile worker's 
          union set up shop on the second floor of Brewer's Pharmacy (now the 
          Campus Florist on Ninth Street). Union-Local 257 later moved to a small 
          wood building at Rosehill and Hillsborough (today, the back of West 
          Durham Tire). </font></p>
