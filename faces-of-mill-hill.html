        <p><em><font color="Navy">We had a three-piece string band from 1950 to
          1953 play every Saturday night upstairs at the Erwin Auditorium. The
          band was called &quot;Tobacco Land Playboys.&quot; It consisted of me,
          Faison Perry on the fiddle, Ike Browning on the bass fiddle and Calvin
          Blake on the guitar. Our square dance caller was Cocky Bennett. He was
          the manager of the Erwin Auditorium. We averaged having about 20 couples
          each Saturday night. The band was paid 10 dollar each for playing each
          night. That was big money at that time. Mr. Norwood Tew replaced Mr.
          Bennett as caller after the first year.</font></em> -Faison Perry</p>
