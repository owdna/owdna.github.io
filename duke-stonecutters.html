        <p>July 16, 1990 marked the end of an era in the history of the construction
          of Duke University. On that date Louis Fara, a native of Frugarola,
          Italy, and the last of the original stone setters who skillfully laid
          the Indiana limestone trim on West Campus, died. Fara was representative
          of a group of laborers whose unique background and contribution will
          be acknowledged as long as eyes gaze upon Duke's majestic Gothic arches.

        <p>Documentation of these laborers' contributions is almost nonexistent.
          Photographs are extremely scarce, since construction took place during
          the Great Depression and laboring families did not frivolously spend
          hard-earned money on family snapshots. A few photographs have turned
          up, usually passport photos of younger men or pictures of much older
          men working on later commissions. Official university construction photos
          concentrate on architectural detail instead of the human element. The
          laborers' background and their sense of accomplishment have to be pieced
          together from scattered published interviews. Fortunately, their names
          are familiar, for many remained in Durham to raise their families. Six
          decades after the completion of West Campus the city telephone directory
          still lists the Italian names of Fara, Ribet, Ferettino, Citrini, and
          Berini. In addition, Giobbi and Greppi worked the stone as well as the
          highly respected stone workers Macadie and Brown. They worked along
          side native blacks and mountain whites who had also migrated to Durham
          in search of steady employment during severe economic times. </p>

        <p>Each laborer became an accomplished artisan at his assigned level of
          work. Stonemasons worked the "rubble" bluestone from the nearby Hillsborough
          quarry. Often thought akin to brick layers, stonemasons did not believe
          the skills were interchangeable. Expert stonemasons had to have a feeling
          for color and design as well as the skill to size and shape each stone.
          These intangible and tangible qualities were vital to the West Campus
          project where the beauty of the stone was in its fourteen plus shades
          of color and where each piece was cut at a ratio of length two times
          height. </p>

        <p>Only the very best men were selected for the more delicate work with
          "cutstone" or Indiana limestone. They were almost all Italians working
          for the subcontractor James W. Brown under the supervision of Donald
          Macadie. Brown and Macadie were natives of Scotland who immigrated to
          the United States early in the century and located in the south as a
          result of assigned commissions. The Italians, too, were most often immigrants
          who came to Duke as word circulated among friends and relatives that
          there was stone work in Durham, North Carolina. Many had been apprenticed
          in the Alps of Italy, Switzerland, or France, as had been Tony Berini,
          for a season's pay of "food, lodging, and a suit of clothes, pair of
          shoes and a bright red cap." In the United States, they were working
          in New York City or the coal mines of West Virginia before answering
          the call to Duke. The stone setters set the arches and doorways throughout
          the campus, capping their employment with the soaring nave of the Chapel.
          When the campus opened in September, 1930, a select crew remained to
          finish the Chapel. They were doubly proud because of the special recognition
          of their expertise and because they were completing such a magnificent
          structure. It was as if every stone setter, particularly those with
          European backgrounds, wanted to work on a Gothic cathedral in their
          lifetime. As the Duke commission finished many worked on nearby government
          building projects financed by the New Deal, and some traveled west to
          build tunnels on the Blue Ridge Parkway. </p>
