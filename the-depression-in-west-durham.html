<h2>The Depression in West Durham</h2>

        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>By Billy B. Olive</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One cannot write
          about the period of 1928 to 1934 without relating this period to the
          very drastic financial strain placed on most families. I will thus recite
          just a few memories of what it meant to live in old West Durham during
          the Depression. Finding housing at a price that could be afforded was
          a challenge for my father particularly. To save expenses, we had to
          share our house with my mother's sister's family.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As my father sought
          cheaper rents, I remember the tears when both families had to move from
          a nice location on Englewood Avenue, which my parents owned, to three
          successive rented locations in old West Durham (including a house on
          Ninth Street). The fact that this same experience befell many others
          helped soften the blow for my parents. However, as part of a large family,
          there was much excitement when we moved to a new house. As I look back,
          I can see that character was being molded. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Flour bags &amp;
          shoes </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Depression
          affected our family in many other ways. My mother made and fed the family
          many biscuits and for this we found it economical to buy flour by the
          bag at two small neighborhood stores on either side of Hillsborough
          Road (near where Strawbridge Studios are today). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Choosing the particular
          bag of flour to be purchased became a matter of choosing the particular
          brand of flour which was bagged in the most attractive print suitable
          for conversion to some kind of garment. All the manufacturers of flour
          soon learned that their customers were using flour bags as an important
          source of cloth for making items such as underwear, towels, shirts,
          handkerchiefs and the like and our family, by necessity, became part
          of this cycle. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Shoe soles were
          expensive to buy when shoes needed to be repaired and while stick-on
          shoe soles were available in the "5 and 10" cent store for perhaps 10
          cents, such amount was not always available when a hole appeared in
          a shoe. Thus, a common expedient at the start of each day when shoes
          could not be repaired was to cut out a piece of cardboard to fit the
          inside of the shoe as a temporary sole and which would usually last
          for a day. As I look back, I can see that I was being taught some basic
          lessons in economics. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Dog days of
          summer</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A cheap way to
          a void the expense of the City building a swimming pool for use during
          the hot summer days involved the local firemen. Thus, a common practice
          of firemen to the delight of children in West Durham was to connect
          a fire hose to a fire hydrant on Alabama Avenue, attach a fire nozzle
          to the hose and elevate the nozzle so that children could dash in and
          out of water sprayed from the nozzle. Such experiences undoubtedly built
          up respect for the firemen in the minds of the children. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">While not related
          to the Depression, there were many other interesting experiences in
          old West Durham that delighted the children. One such experience involved
          the iceman who would deliver blocks of ice to be stored in people's
          ice boxes as a source of cooling. The iceman who was the greatest favorite
          among the children was the iceman who knew how to skillfully use his
          ice pick on a hot summer day so that every child got a least one chip
          of ice on which to suck. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="/old/graphics/history/f016.jpg" width="466" height="126"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font color="Navy">Seven
          ice trucks (ca. 1930): The Durham Public Service Company not only furnished
          ice but also operated Durham's transportation and and electrical systems.
          The Duke Power Co. later took over the electrical and transportation
          facilities. Public Service Co. of N.C. is the name now used by the distributor
          of natural gas. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Disease in the
          community</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another memory
          relates to how infectious diseases were publicized in the West Durham
          community. When anyone in a family came down with any one of several
          diseases such as influenza, measles, chicken pox or mumps, a sign of
          a particular color would be tacked onto the front of the house with
          a warning to all visitors.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Needless to say,
          the removal of such a sign was always an event to be welcomed particularly
          in a large family since one child's sickness affected all members of
          the family and its hardship had to be shared. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>West Durham
          Airport</b></font></p>

          for takeoff (Durham, ca. 1920). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another event which
          I relate to West Durham concerns my first flight in an airplane which
          took place at what was then called the West Durham Airport and whose
          counterpart was the then existing East Durham Airport. The beginning
          of the runway for the West Durham Airport began just west of the intersection
          of the present Albany and Sovereign Streets and went downhill generally
          towards Alabama Avenue and over much of what is now the Hillandale Golf
          Course. </font></p>

          called E Street).</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On this particular
          day, a friend and myself somehow got up our "nerve" and the necessary
          $10 charge and we found ourselves seated side by side in a Ford Trimotor
          aircraft. With a roar, we went bumping down the dirt runway and took
          off skimming over the trees on Club Boulevard. It was an experience
          I have never forgot and which, while it is my fondest recollection of
          the West Durham Airport, is only one of my experiences associated with
          the West Durham Airport. I particularly recall seeing a stunt man walking
          on the wing of a biplane and a parachutist making his downward fall
          with a white plume which was probably a bag of flour being dumped. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Hillsborough
          &amp; Hillandale Roads</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A special place
          remains in my store of memories for the West Durham Lumber Company.
          As a young boy interested in building a rabbit box, a skate scooter
          or something similar, I was always able to find a friend at the West
          Durham Lumber Company who would give me a few scrap boards or handful
          of nails and send me on my way with a word of encouragement. Such experiences
          helped keep me usefully occupied and perhaps taught me many other things.
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="/old/graphics/history/e019.jpg" width="394" height="265"><br>
          </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="Navy">Hillsboro
          Road in 1929 (Durham Public Service Co.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the old days,
          Hillandale Road was a narrow, unpaved dirt road which provided a place
          for stunts to be performed and witnessed. At one time, a two-man stunt
          team drove an old, probably a Dodge, touring car. The car would start
          at the top of the hill on Hillandale Road at its intersection with Hillsborough
          Road. One of the men would be driving and the other man would be standing
          blindfolded on the car's running board next to the side of the road
          and in a crouched position. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At some critical
          time, indicated by the driver with a flourish and related to the relatively
          slow speed and loud noise of the car, the blindfolded stunt man would
          jump off the car, tumble in the dirt and then would remove his blindfold,
          stand and bow to the crowd with great applause. A passing of a hat and
          collection of donations would follow. I remember trying to figure out
          how this could all happen repeatedly with no apparent injury to the
          stunt man. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>The Circus Comes
          to Town</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The old circus
          ground used to be at a Hillsborough Road location now occupied by a
          Kroger Store and a shopping center. The Ringling Brothers Barnum and
          Bailey circus would unload its rail cars opposite the East Duke Campus
          and would march the animals and circus vehicles to the circus ground.
          One day it was particularly hot when the circus arrived and word went
          out that with the animals being thirsty, a free ticket would be given
          to anyone who showed up with an empty washtub at the fire hydrant located
          at the intersection of Hillandale and Hillsborough Road. Needless to
          say, the tubs arrived, the animals got watered and many children in
          the community enjoyed a free circus matinee.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>E.K. Powe School</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Memories of E.K.
          Powe School recall a practice of requiring all the students to listen
          to an approximately one-hour radio program of music called, as I recall,
          the "Walter Damrosch Hour." It was here that we learned about sharps,
          flats, musical terms and musical instruments all of which has lasted
          through the years. I remember always looking forward to this wonderful
          hour and learning about some of the mysteries of music. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fire Chief Frank
          Bennett visited E.K. Powe and sang songs which caught our attention
          and effectively taught us the dangers of oily rags and how a magnifying
          glass could start a fire. Even today, I find myself very sensitive to
          fire hazards. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Old West Durham
          lives on. With the recited experiences in old West Durham as a start
          in life, the writer, Billy B. Olive, went on to become a graduate of

          feat. During the 1970s when my grandchild was growing up near the reservoir,
          one of her little friends asked her father what the precious little
          building in the reservoir was. He said it was Santa Claus' summer home.
