<h2>The Changing Landscape of the Erwin Mills Area</h2>

        twin arrivals of Trinity College and Erwin Mills in 1892 would transform
        West Durham forever. No single event was more important to Old West Durham
        than the arrival of Erwin Cotton Mills. According to author, Jean Anderson,
        the two-story brick factory included a picker building, dyehouse, boiler
        room, and engine house. The mills had 11,000 spindles and 360 looms producing
        a variety of fabrics. Rows of neat houses were built for the workers.
        By 1895, some 375 families were living in the mill village which is, today,
        the heart of a national historic district. </font> </P>

         An aerial view of Erwin Cotton Mills. The old West Durham

         post office is located in the bottom-right corner of the

         photo (on the corner of West Main and Ninth Street next to

         the mill pond -- where Wachovia Bank is today). Across Main

         Street (to the left) is the old Erwin Auditorium -- Durham's

         first park. The park was lost to the Durham Freeway. At the

         top of the photo, mill houses can be seen -- right up to the

         walls of the mill. Several of the homes closest to the mills

         were torn down (where Kerr Drugs and the neighborhood

         "greenspace" on Hillsborough Road are today). Greystone

         Baptist Church can barely be seen at the top-left (where

         Hillsborough Road turns toward Hillandale Road). From the

         Greater Durham Chamber of Commerce Papers.</FONT></P>

      <P><strong>From Mills to More (Urban Land Institute, April 2003)</strong></P>
      <p><font color="navy">Despite problems, developers and architects throughout
        the Southeast are working to convert former textile mills into multifamily
        properties.</font></p>
      <p><font color="navy">Between 1880 and 1920, the heart of the U.S. textile
        industry shifted from New England to the Southeast, where labor was still
        relatively cheap. Expansion to the southern states was swift. In North
        Carolina alone, more than six new mills were built each year between 1880
        and 1900, reports Gerald Ingalls, director of Public Policy at the University
        of North Carolina in Charlotte. "By 1900, there were 177 mills in the
        state." The South&acute;s importance in the textile industry lasted for
        about a century, but with globalization and inexpensive labor available
        elsewhere in the world, U.S. production declined steadily for a number
        of decades, leaving empty mills scattered about the Southeast. </font></p>
      <p><font color="navy">The silver lining in this economic shift is that many
        of these mills are the original buildings constructed during the wave
        of expansion at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th
        century and they remain architecturally significant, structurally imposing,
        and strong enough for adaptive use. Many are being turned into lofts,
        apartments, and affordable housing.</font></p>
      <p><font color="black">Erwin Cotton Mills</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">Other than the establishment of Trinity College,
        the most important event in the commercial history of the West Durham
        neighborhood in Durham, North Carolina, was the building of the Erwin
        Cotton Mills in 1893, boasting 11,000 spindles and 360 looms. When homes
        were built for workers, 375 families moved in, creating a "mill village."</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The end of the line for Erwin Mills came in 1986
        and soon after some of the structures were torn down. All the workers
        lost their jobs and the neighborhood hit rock bottom, remembers John Schelp,
        president of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association. To make matters
        worse, a mall opened outside of town and the neighborhood&acute;s once
        vibrant Ninth Street soon was left with only vacant storefronts. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">By the late 1980s, however, efforts began to revive
        Erwin Mills. Although one of the old buildings was torn down and a modern,
        mid-rise built in its place, another of the larger structures was saved
        and renovated for use as apartments and offices. "It was a beautiful building
        with large windows and brick arches," says Schelp. "And the effort to
        revitalize that mill was a shot in the arm for the neighborhood, setting
        off a ripple effect in new development projects." </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">New, high-density apartments are to be built in
        the open area behind the mill. "It will all be red brick with historic
        touches," Schelp notes. Ninth Street has been most affected, he says.
        "All the shops are full&#151;with a lot of restaurants, everything from
        Lebanese to sushi. It has really changed."</font></p>

      <P><font color="#000080">When the wheels of Erwin Mills were ready to turn
        in 1893, a local editorial declared: &quot;The anti-trust shriekers went
        into their closets and wept bitterly<br>
        over the hopeless degeneracy of the times, painfully and pathetically
        recalling with regret the good old days when every man made his own homespun,
        dined on ash cake and drank sassafras tea for breakfast.&quot;</font></P>
