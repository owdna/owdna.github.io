                River Mills: Alamance County is considered the cradle of cotton mills
                in North Carolina. The bridge on the left is Old NC 10 -- the first
                highway which traversed the state. Old NC 10 also passed Erwin Mills

              <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By 1900, a full
                92 percent of textile workers lived in mill villages owned by the companies
                that employed them. Usually, the mill village included a supervisor's
                home, houses for workers and their families, one or more churches, a
                school, and the company store. In the early 1900s, most mill houses
                were one-story, four-room affairs, lit by kerosene lamps and heated
                by open fireplaces. Workers drew water from common wells and pumps,
                and less than 7 percent of mills in 1907-1908 had sewer facilities more
                elaborate than simple privies. Many manufacturers had a rule that required
                families to supply one worker for each room occupied, further encouraging
                the entry of children into the mills. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The closeness
                to the factory had its advantages for millhands, but it also meant that
                mill managers could keep close tabs on their employees, sometimes using
                supervisors or mill village policemen for surveillance. Mills often
                supported the churches in the villages, paying the salaries of ministers
                or providing maintenance and heat for the buildings, and, in turn, the
                donations from mill owners frequently shaped the message from the pulpit.
                Not surprisingly, some company-supported pastors preached a gospel that
                favored the company's interests. </font> </p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mills also sponsored
                village schools, sometimes providing buildings and paying teachers&rsquo;
                salaries. Supervisors would often send for children in the school when
                extra workers were needed in the mill. &quot;Owners had little to gain by
                enforcing school attendance, since children who became ensnared by the
                factory at an early age were less likely to seek employment elsewhere
                as adults. These conditions improved only in the mid-1910s after schooling
                was made mandatory for all children under twelve years of age. Mills
                operated company stores and often sponsored a variety of other small
                businesses such as barber shops and pool halls. Those establishments
                were a convenience to workers, but they could also serve to keep millhands
                in debt to their employers. </font><br />

                  </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mills also provided
                social workers, recreational activities, clubs, and educational opportunities,
                in part to provide better living conditions to their employees, but
                also to make sure that, in a time of labor shortage, millhands were
                satisfied enough that they would not seek employment elsewhere. Mill
                owners also hoped that the benefits they supplied to employees would
                silence critics from outside the mills who worried about poor working
                and living conditions, child labor, and mill village poverty. The results,
                however, were often disappointing. For their part, mill workers recognized
                that the sewing clubs, nurseries, and baseball teams offered by the
                companies were intended to keep them docile and loyal. Some workers
                refused to participate or created their own recreational activities
                as alternatives to company-sponsored options. Still others took part
                in the programs but did not buy into the company's intended message.
                They demanded higher pay and better conditions even as they took full
                advantage of the clubs and other activities. </font> </p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Company &quot;welfare
                work&quot; failed to produce dramatic results because workers drew on the
                strengths of their own communities to avoid dependence on their employers.
                Millhands brought remnants of their lives on the farm with them and
                insisted on having gardens, barns for their animals, and chicken coops
                in the villages. They socialized together, often gathering for music
                and dancing, and helped their neighbors during difficult times, just
                as many had done in rural communities. Mill workers also created their
                own alternative churches and held emotional revivals that worried many
                mill owners. </font> </p>
              <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Viewed from the
                outside, mill villages seemed to deny workers the most basic forms of
                self-expression. But in muddy streets and cramped cottages cotton mill
                people managed to shape a way of life beyond their employers&rsquo; grasp.
                Millhands' habits and beliefs were more than remnants of a rural past;
                they were instruments of power and protection, survival and self-respect,
                molded into a distinctive mill village culture. Sometimes that culture
                simply defended workers against condescension and economic hardship.
                At other times, it bred a spirit of independence that threatened the
                village's purpose as an institution of labor control. In either case,
                it offered assurance that mill folks were &lsquo;fine, honest, hard-working
                people.&rsquo;&quot; </font> </p>

              <p><font size="2" color="#000000">Preservation North Carolina has been
                increasingly involved with the preservation of the state's industrial
                heritage - working to preserve mills and mill villages across the state.
                Why the great interest in the state's industrial heritage? The properties
                with which our revolving fund works tend to reflect both the state of
                preservation and the economic trends in North Carolina... </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#000000">Today, the the distressed properties
                of choice for preservationists are industrial properties. Our work with
                mill properties is merely a reflection of changes in North Carolina's
                economy. North Carolina's industrial base has been changing this decade
                in response to changes in the global economy. The state's traditional
                industries -- textiles, tobacco manufacturing and furniture -- are faced
                with international competition. As a result, businesses which do not
                move to third world countries are focusing on manufacturing efficiency.
                The giant factories built at the turn of the century are being vacated
                at a dizzying pace. According to a 1997 article in the Raleigh News
                and Observer, 138 textile mills had been vacated in North Carolina in
                the previous seven years. That pace has not slowed. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#000000">These historic industrial properties
                present both challenges and opportunities for local communities. A large
                vacant mill can be a cancer, if it remains vacant and unused. Neighborhoods
                and commercial districts surrounding a vacant mill will deteriorate
                and crime will increase. The building itself will be subject to vandalism,
                vagrancy and arson. Businesses and individuals looking for relocation
                opportunities will perceive a huge abandoned building as sign of community
                deterioration. The community spirals downward. </font> </p>

              <p><font size="2" color="#000000">Renovated for new adaptive uses or for
                new industrial or business uses, a large old factory or mill can provide
                an economic boost. Used as apartments, condos, offices or shops, it
                may attract tourists and stimulate new economic growth. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#000000">In larger cities, the reuse of large
                old industrial buildings is relatively easy. The spaces are inexpensive
                to purchase and renovate; the buildings are often located close to downtowns
                and can play a role in downtown revitalization. Rents or sales prices
                can justify upfitting for new uses. North Carolina's new rehabilitation
                tax credits aid immeasurably in making such adaptive uses financially
                feasible. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#000000">One thing we have learned over the years
                is that the environmental problems at old mills are not necessarily
                as bad as the rumor mill asserts. We heard over and over that Loray
                Mill [Gastonia, NC] was highly contaminated, but the environmental assessment
                didn't bear that out at all. A 1993 real estate appraisal wrote Glencoe
                [Burlington, NC] off as undevelopable because of supposed environmental
                hazards, but scientific analysis revealed few problems. The lesson is
                to ascertain the facts about environmental conditions rather than listening
                to hearsay. </font> </p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#000000">We have also learned that the interest
                in preserving these industrial buildings is widespread and contagious.
                The mill houses have been popular for a &quot;new breed of buyers&quot; (to quote
                an article from The Wall Street Journal about mill villages), and the
                idea of trendy condos in towns denigrated as &quot;blue collar&quot; has been
                catching on. City and county officials, chambers of commerce, and others
                have joined with preservationists in working to find new uses for industrial
                buildings. </font> </p>
