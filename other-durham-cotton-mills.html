          the world's largest hosiery mill complex and the nation's largest producer 
          of silk stockings. It eventually became the only mill in the country 
          staffed entirely by African-American employees. Today the main mill 
          building provides affordable housing for seniors and is on the National 
          Register of Historic Places. (Photo ca. 1910) </font></p>

            <td height="254"> <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                history of Smoky Hollow goes back to the 1830s&acute; notorious 
                Prattsburg saloon, which stood just about at the present corner 
                of Lyon Street and Angier Avenue. As Durham developed later, the 
                bottomland along present Alston Avenue became the town&acute;s 
                red-light district. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When tycoon 
                Julian Carr proposed building the Durham Hosiery Mill there in 
                1900, the Durham Daily Sun rejoiced: "In place of this dark hole 
                of iniquity and infamy, there will be a busy, bustling manufacturing 
                community." </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A village, 
                which Carr dubbed "Edgemont," grew up to serve several textile 
                mills. With changing tastes and fashions in the 1920s, however, 
                the East Durham textile business began unraveling. By 1940, only 
                one mill remained in operation. Neighborhood businesses shut down; 
                mill housing was sold to rental investors; poverty settled in 
                and crime went up. (source: Herald-Sun)</font></p></td>
