          <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Erwin Auditorium, built in 
          1922. It was a recreation center for Erwin Mills employees. Local builder 
          Joe Berini (whose father came to Durham to work as a stone mason at 
          Duke Chapel) spent his childhood in a house on Hillsborough Road -- 
          near Wallace Electric. In the 1920s, Hillsborough was a dirt road and 
          often muddy. Berini recalls that prior to Durham annexing West Durham 
          in 1925, the neighborhood had running water but no sewage services. 
          As a result, most homes had outhouses in the back yard. He also remembers 
          that Duke's current Central Campus, and along Erwin Road, was a large 
          neighborhood of mill homes. &quot;Erwin Auditorium was the best thing ever 
          done in Durham,&quot; Berini said. &quot;Kids came home from school and had a 
          place to go.&quot; Finally, Berini recalls people used to fish at the large 
          mill pond on Hillsborough Road (near Carolina Ave). &quot;They were crazy. 
          You'd never know what was in that water.&quot; (Photo courtesy of Historic 
          Preservation Society of Durham). <b>Below</b>: Auditorium in August

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to long-time 
          resident Faye James Cates, the old West Durham Library was in the entire 
          west side of the Erwin Auditorium. EA also offered large rooms for ping 
          pong, club meetings, theater, and a first floor lounge. The downstairs 
          had a swimming pool, bowling alley, soda fountain (run by Oonie Hawley) 
          and showers. Some men would use the showers for their Saturday night 
          bath. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A favorite place 
          at the EA was the basketball court that was also used as the movie theater. 
          Boys sat on one side while girls sat on the other. The stage was used 
          for the boys to wrestle with one another. EA had tennis courts and a 
          community park outside. </font>

        <p><font color="Navy" size="2">West Durham, under the enlightened paternalism 
          of mill<br />
          magnate William A. Erwin, was a mill village of<br />
          advanced design. Even before 1920, Erwin introduced<br />
          lights and plumbing, a day-care center and<br />
          playgrounds. In 1922 he built a three-story auditorium<br />
          with a bowling alley, library, and classrooms for <br />
          instruction in the &quot;domestic sciences.&quot; Erwin Mills<br />
          also sponsored contests and awarded prizes to those<br />
          workers with the best-kept yards, or those who were<br />
          best in cooking and canning foods. </font><font size="2"><br />
