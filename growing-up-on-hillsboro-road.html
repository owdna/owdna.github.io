<h2>Growing Up On Hillsboro Road</h2>

        <p><strong><font color="Black" size="2">Ruie and Bertie Eubanks sitting in their yard 
          at 730 Fifteenth Street (ca. 1943). Hillsboro Road is seen in the background. 
          The bus is heading toward what was called West End where Hillandale, 
          Englewood and Hillsboro Road intersected. The street directly behind 
          Mr. and Mrs. Eubanks is 15th Street. West Durham Baptist Church is to 
          the far left of the picture. You can see the wall near the front doors 
          of what is now called Greystone Baptist.</font></strong></p>
        <p><font color="Black" size="2"><strong>Whenever the circus came to town, neighbors 
          would sit on the wall and watch the circus animals go by (from the RR 
          station on West Main Street to what is now the Kroger store on Hillsboro 
          Rd). </strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="Black" size="2"><strong>The road in front of the Coca-Cola sign is 16th 
          Street (now Warner). The Coca-Cola sign is on the wall of a building 
          housing the barber shop, Fent's eating place (best food in Durham!) 
          and Ideal Sundries. Before Bill Holmes, Doc Newton was the wonderful 
          man who ran the drugstore. The Hester family lived just past the drugstore 
          on Hillsboro.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="Black" size="2"><strong>Across Hillsboro Road is a neighborhood 
          grocery store (now Fisher Signs). The Ideal Sundry eventually moved 
          across the street. The Ice Plant stood on the next corner, past 16th 
          Street.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="Black" size="2"><strong>OWD friend Nancy &quot;Goat&quot; 
          Eubanks remembers their large yard at 15th and Hillsboro as being a 
          great place to sit and count cars coming down Highway 70 (Hillsboro 
          Road). Sometimes as many as ten or twelve cars would pass in one evening! 
          Goat also reports that she still has one of the chairs from this photo, 
          on her deck.</strong></font><br>

        <p><font size="2">Listening to someone reminisce about growing up in West 
          Durham in the 30's and 40's would be, to say the least, incomprehensible 
          for most people today. I have often tried to tell my children how it 
          was: we could walk anywhere, anytime we wanted - alone or in a crowd. 
          Windows and doors were left open in the summertime without worry. I 
          could catch the bus and go to a movie downtown at night with friends 
          - they on the Erwin Road bus and me on the Hillsboro Road one, meeting 
          at and departing from the bus stop at Five Points. My children have 
          often said they wish they had lived in an era like that. It's really 
          difficult for them to imagine how it was when I was a little girl. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The entire community was drawn together when Mr. Erwin 
          decided to make the neighborhood a place where &quot;his people&quot; 
          would have wholesome entertainment and a place for good, family fun. 
          Just coming out of the Depression, no one was wealthy moneywise, but 
          as a neighborhood full of love and respect for each other - as human 
          beings, neighbors, friends - we were rich beyond anything that words 
          can convey. Everyone worked hard together, worshiped each in their own 
          church, played together, and lived as a unit. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Traffic on Hillsboro Road </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">One of my family's &quot;claim to fame&quot; (an extremely 
          dubious honor) was when a truck ran into our house. We lived where the 
          Greystone Baptist Church parking lot is on the corner of Fifteenth Street 
          and Hillsborough Road (then spelled Hillsboro Road). I was born there 
          in 1934 into a family of three sisters and one brother. Trucks, cars, 
          motorcycles all came crashing into our yard at times over the years. 
          Occasionally we would hear a truck or car coming down the hill and someone 
          would say: &quot;That one isn't going to make it.&quot; Often the prediction 
          was right on target and the vehicle would turn over in the lower part 
          of our yard. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">On one 1940 school morning around 7:00 or 7:30, as I 
          recall, an 18 wheeler came barreling down the highway, missed the curve, 
          and plowed through Dad's well-groomed hedges, across our yard and into 
          the house right under the raised living room window. (It didn't even 
          break, believe it or not.) Back-to-back fireplaces in the living room 
          and one of the bedrooms, created a very large square brick pillar under 
          the house and this is what stopped the truck from passing right on through 
          the house. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The house was built on a sloping lot which placed it 
          a little better than six feet off the ground in the back and almost 
          on the ground at the front door. Our dad was getting ready to leave 
          for his job hauling coal to Erwin Mill employees. As he stood by his 
          truck, he heard a loud noise and saw house shift several feet right 
          in front of his eyes. We still wonder what kept the house from collapsing 
          - but by the Grace of God, it stood firm. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Mother had sent me across the road to Mr. Wallace's 
          store on Rosehill Avenue leaving mother, my three sisters and my brother 
          inside the house at the time. Hearing his family's screams, our dad 
          bounded up thirteen steps dodging huge pieces of chimney falling all 
          around him, any one of which could have killed him. But the Grace of 
          God stepped in again. Daddy took charge inside the house making sure 
          everyone was all right and escorting them all outside. Then he began 
          looking for me. Not knowing where I was, he assumed I had been in a 
          swing in the front yard (in the path of the truck) where I sat every 
          morning to wave good-bye to him as he drove off to work (without me!! 
          school really got in my way cause I always &quot;worked&quot; with Daddy 
          until school interfered). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">[CAPTION TEXT] Car-train Collision (ca. 1940): On the 
          other side of West Durham, an utterly demolished Bluebird taxi cab still 
          on tracks in front of train locomotive with billows of smoke coming 
          from inside. Three people were killed when the Southern Railway passenger 
          train collided with the cab at Mulberry Street (present-day West Main, 
          near Erwin Mills). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Grabbing the truck driver up by the collar, Dad began 
          trying to get information about my whereabouts, asking if he had seen 
          me. The driver seemed totally unconcerned about the situation and before 
          Dad knocked his block off, a neighbor told Dad someone was bringing 
          me across the road from Mr. Wallace's Store. Finally, Daddy was relieved 
          to have all his chicks within his arms' length. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To show you how things have changed in 60 years - the 
          day they pulled the truck out of our house leaving a gaping hole in 
          it, there was no looting. No one took advantage of the fact that we 
          had to move out of the house while it was repaired. Not one thing disappeared 
          from our house. And shock of all shocks - an impending law suit against 
          the trucking company yielded exactly what my mother and father asked 
          for: enough money to repair the house and replace the living room furniture 
          which had been destroyed. According to their attorney, they could have 
          won a suit worth much, much more money. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">But our parents were people of honor - as were most 
          all of West Durham people - and they only accepted what they felt they 
          were entitled to which, in their opinion, was only what they needed 
          to get their lives back to normal. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">All of this may sound Pollyana-ish to those of you who 
          did not grow up in West Durham. But I really doubt that - because when 
          Chlorese (my sister) and I met some of the &quot;newcomers&quot; to 
          the area (and several of us oldies were there, too) at a recent Old 
          West Durham gathering in a restaurant, we found a love for the community 
          and a warmness that was truly reminiscent of our childhood. We really 
          enjoyed meeting people who now are fortunate enough to have the claim 
          of being a part of a haven called: West Durham. </font></p>
