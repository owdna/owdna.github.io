        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">September 14, 1938

          </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The last of the

          summer petunias lent a splash of bright color to the small, smoothly-sown

          yard of No. 715, 15th St. On the porch, a lazy black cat curled himself

          against the leather cushion of the porch glider. The front door stood

          ajar and through it a mild breeze carried the refreshing coolness of

          an early September day into the living room to the right of the small

          entrance hall. The fresh [serim?] curtains at the windows stirred lightly

          with now and then a flurry when a cross current brought a stronger and

          chillier breeze into the room. </font> </p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The day was Saturday

          of September, 1938. It was a good day of a good year for James Jackson.

          The day was good because only that morning he had made the last payment

          on his eighteen-months old Plymouth car. The year was good because in

          January he had been made second hand in the spinning room at $27.50

          a week. The twelve percent cut which came in July reduced his wage to

          a little less than $25 but that left enough for him to live on comfortably.

          His wife worked in the mill until two months ago and made $15 a week.

          </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">They have been

          able to save for their first child which will arrive within the next

          month. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">James is thirty-two

          and his straight, well-built body, clear complexion and bright eyes

          stand as proof of the good health he has always enjoyed. He and his

          wife now share their four-room house with his mother and his eighteen-year

          old brother, Clarence. The young Jacksons and Mrs. Jackson occupy the

          two bedrooms and Clarence sleeps on a cot in the roam which is used

          as a combination of kitchen and dining room. This three-purpose room

          has in it no space for storing the canned fruits and vegetables which

          the older Mrs. Jackson prepared during the summer. Consequently the

          jars have been arranged in neat rows across the corner near the fireplace

          in the living room and just opposite the upright piano. There are two

          hundred jars of beans, tomatoes, corn, peaches, pickles, and preserves.

          All the vegetables were gathered from the Jackson garden just back of

          the house. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">James Jackson sat

          in his living room on this Saturday in September and discussed the company

          for which he works. "I don't know of a better company to work for,"

          he declared. "The officials here have the worker's interests at heart.

          They've furnished us with a fine Auditorium where a person can find

          free amusement if he wants to. They order coal in big lots and sell

          it to us without profit for $6.50 a ton. They keep the houses in good

          repair and rent them to us for almost nothing. I pay $1.50 a week for

          my four rooms, bath room, and garage. If I didn't live in a company

          house I'd have to pay $5 a week for a house not kept in as good condition

          to this. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"There are very

          few people working in the mill who make less than $12 a week when they

          work full time. Some of the help's sent out now and then as much as

          a day out of a week to rest but never more than that. We make standard

          goods -- sheets and pillow cases, you know -- and we generally have

          orders on hand all the time. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I feel like people

          living here at this mill have as good or better chance for a decent

          living as most people working in stores, in offices, and such places

          where they don't make any more than we do and have a sight more house

          rent to pay. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Of course the

          company don't have enough houses for all its help. There's some working

          in the mills here that's paying $20 a month for rent because they caint

          get a company house. But the majority of us has the advantage over other

          working people when it comes to rent." </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There was about

          James Jackson spirit of well-being as he talked of the company and of

          his own life. It seemed to spring from his conviction that he had worked

          for what he had gotten and had gotten what he had worked for. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">James, one of eight

          children, was born on his father's small farm in Sampson County and

          lived there until he was ten years old. By that time his father, who

          had quit farming for railroad work a few years earlier, had decided

          that a steady wage was better than the uncertainties of farm production

          and farm prices. He moved his family first to Erwin Cotton Mill at Erwin,

          then to the East Durham Mill, and later to the West Durham will where

          James still lives. The elder Jackson died a year after his youngest

          child, Clarence, was born. Up to that time all the children of school

          age had been able to remain in school. James completed the eighth grade

          after which he began a course in bookkeeping. Convinced that he was

          not suited to the type of work he quit the course and went into the

          spinning room at the age of fifteen. There he has remained and availed

          himself of his opportunities to learn all he could about his work. He

          has attended a number of the textile courses offered in night school

          by the mill officials and he completed a correspondence course in textile

          work from the International Correspondence Schools. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Six years after

          the elder Jackson's death his widow decided to moved out into the country,

          but not too far for her children to drive into Durham for their work.

          She bought on time-payment a home and six acres at Bragtown, about five

          miles out, and here three of her children not yet old enough to work

          in the mill raised truck produce. The children who worked in town took

          the vegetables and sold them to certain stores which could handle all

          the small farm could supply. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After eight years

          the farm was paid for and the younger members of the family had secured

          work in the mill. Mrs. Jackson rented her farm and moved back to the

          mill village. Today all of her children except Clarence are married,

          and half of them live at the mill while the others live in the country.

          </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Clarence who is

          now in the tenth grade has supported himself by working in the mill

          since he was fifteen. He quit school after finishing the ninth grade

          and after a lapse of three years he has decided to finish high school.

          He is one of the sixty-five students attending the Durham High School

          Co-operative Class, a class organized for working boys ambitious to

          complete their high school training. It is conducted so as to fit in

          with the working schedule of all of its members. Clarence who works

          in the mill from 3:30 in the afternoon until 12 at night attends classes

          in the morning from 9 o'clock until 12. "it's pretty hard," he says,

          "but I'm going to stick it through this year and two more. After that,

          I don't know what I'll do, but at least I won't be turned down for a

          job just because I don't have a high school education. I may stay right

          on in the mill and work up like James. There's not many jobs for the

          working man that pays more than $25 a week. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"And they don't

          come by just wishing for 'em" James told his brother, that Saturday

          he'd finished paying for his car. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">She seems hewn

          from rough granite, this woman who sits in her front room and talks

          while her slowly changing expression brings at long intervals a kindly,

          creeping smile to her ruddy face. Her features though definite and firm

          in outline have a roughness which makes one think the chiseler laid

          down his tools before the surface had been smoothed. Change and time

          have moved about her and brought age to her body, but her mind has remained

          impervious to change. The beliefs of her childhood are the mainstay

          of her old age. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A tiny light of

          learning come into her life as a child, and with creditable effort she

          clung to it and passed it on in such measure as she could to her own

          children. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I shall set down

          in her own words the story of Ida Allen as she told it to me the other

          day while I sat with her in her front room which contained a cheap settee,

          two chairs, a table, and a linoleum rug. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I was born in

          Chatham County, the second of Sid Reagin's six children. Pa was a good

          man, always sober and a steady worker. He was thoughtful of Ma and took

          the best care of her he knowed how. Ma was a weakly woman and Pa seen

          to it that she stayed in bed for four or five weeks after each one of

          her children was born. He had a doctor with her every time too, and

          not all poor folks in them days had doctors. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Before going to

          the field of a morning at such times when Ma was ailing, he'd lift her

          outa bed and set her in a chair. When she got weary of settin' I'd go

          and call Pa, and he'd come and put her in the bed agin. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Before he was

          married Pa had fought to help free the colored people. He never believed

          that slavery was right and it taint. Pa never had much of a chance himself

          and he never learned to write his name. For generations we've been poor

          people and before me there was none in the family could read. Take Pa

          though; he'd been glad of a little schoolin' if there'd been any way

          for him to get it. I'll tell you why I know in a minute. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Pa sent me to

          a four month's school that cost him a dollar a month. They wasn't free

          schools in them days and only a few got learning. But it was in me to

          learn more then I could get in them four months. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We lived on Stroud's

          place then and Mrs. Stroud was my Sunday school teacher. She seen how

          well I done my Sundry school lesson and she took to havin' me come to

          her house for school lessons. I got to where I could do fair readin'

          and writin' and figurin'. They was plenty in them days that got all

          the schoolin' they ever had from Sundry school teachers that was willin'

          to teach them for nothin'. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Now comin' back

          to Pa and the reason I think he'd been proud of a little learning. I've

          never knowed a person that loved to hear readin' more than him. I got

          to where I could read any part of the Bible with fair understandin',

          and of a night after he'd gone to bed, tired out from a hard day's work,

          I'd set and read to him by the light of a light'ood knot. He loved most

          of all to hear about the kings of Israel. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They wasn't any

          foolishness atall about Pa and his younguns was never seen at no sort

          of party. He said a party was a place where young folks got in trouble

          and he was goin' to help us stay outa trouble. Till this day I ain't

          never been to no party and to no picture show neither. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Folks seem awful

          careless about love in these times to me. It taint a good thing for

          young girls to read these love story magazines and such like. Hit puts

          ideas in they heads that's got no business there. I've never read no

          love story of no kind. Love ain't nothin' to be trifled with, and as

          for goin' with first one and then the other I think its a pure sin.

          </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They was one boy

          that come courtin' me and I married him. Bob Allen and me played together

          when we was children, and then after we was both growed up he took to

          walkin' home with me from Sunday School of a Sunday. He was twenty-three

          and I was twenty when we got married. Bob was a wage hand then, gettin'

          twenty-dollars a month. He kept on at that job and I worked such little

          patches as I could get. When the children come along and was big enough

          to work I sometimes raised two bales of cotton a year. We had our own

          hogs and a cow, and we lived right well. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Then Bob's health

          give away. He took down with the consumption and he knowed he didn't

          have long to live. He said that me and the children couldn't make a

          living on the farm and he wanted to move to the cotton mill where the

          children could take care of theyselves. They worked children in the

          mills them days. You know, little ones not more then nine or ten year

          old. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We moved to Carrboro

          and the children went to work. They never made much but put together

          it was enough to feed us. Then I took in washin' for awhile till I got

          a chance to go to work in the mill. In less than two years Bob had wasted

          away with the consumption and died. We was a long time payin' for his

          buryin'. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Eighteen year

          ago we moved to Durham. We worked some at East Durham and then got on

          here at West Durham. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"My children are

          all married now with families of they own -- all except Louise. Last

          week she drawed $9 from the mill and it's like that most times. They

          send her out for restin' pretty near a day out of every week and she

          don't have a chance to draw full pay. Me and her and my son's child

          live on that. My son Ned was killed on the railroad and he left his

          wife with five children. I took Annie, next to the youngest, to raise

          and since they ain't no way for me to make money the burden falls to

          Louise. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"I've got one son

          making $16 a week when he don't have to rest none but he's got six children

          to support outa that. His daughter Ella had to be operated on for the

          appendicitis in June and he's still payin' on her doctor's bill. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"They's not a child

          I've got that's really able to take care of me. I put in for the old

          age pension, and after a long time it started comin' and come three

          months. Now I don't get it no more. If I had education enough to put

          my reasonin' down on paper, I'd write a letter to Governor Hoey and

          explain to his that I'm almost compelled to have that $10 a month if

          I keep on livin'. None of my children can write it for me either because

          they ain't got no more learnin' than me. It was never so I could send

          them to school much, and most of what they know is what I learnt 'em

          myself. I've not got one that caint read and write some though. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Old ones caint

          get jobs no more, you know. I'm seventy-two. Maybe if they caint get

          it straightened out about the old age pension they'll pass a law for

          doin' away with us old ones that's in the way." </font>

          We had a large white house, plenty of good food, good clothes,- then

          along came ole Roosevelt, and his Emergency Banking Relief Act. He closed

          our bank, and took all of our money, all of our hard-earned savings.

          We were forced to sell the farm, all of the land, and all of our belongings.

          We wondered the streets for months searching for work and shelter. Luckily,

          I heard about a job at a mill in Durham." </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beth Jackson is

          a woman in her thirties, has long brown ragged hair and wears an old

          stained blue and white dress everyday. Shortly after the Jacksons arrived

          in Durham, Beth received permission from the superintendent of the mill

          to learn how to fill batteries. She did so for three weeks, hoping she

          will be offered a position and be paid. Her prayers were answered on

          the third Saturday, "the superintendent called me over and said he was

          going to put me to work." </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beth states that

          Walter is not content with his job. He is considered the best doffer

          in the mill, however during full-time work he makes less than eight

          dollars a week. "I once suggested that he should look into the WPA as

          a carpenter." However he responded angrily and in disbelief, "I will

          never work for the same people who took our money, our homes and our

          lives." The subject was never mentioned again. "I feel sorry for him."

          Beth says, "he used to be so well off, now he must be humiliated that

          he can barely support his family." He is a bright handsome boy, who

          is very loyal to his family. William constantly labors in the cotton

          fields, deprived from using knowledge he had learned previously. He

          now has no time for any sort of education. He returns home each day

          with meager pay, a black dirty face, and soars and filth covering his

          body. "I remember the days where all I had to worry about was school

          work," William recalls, "Now I pick cotton for thirteen hours a day,

          then return home being welcomed by a bowl of cold rice and cornmeal.

          The mill owner, James, is cruel and does not treat the workers fairly,

          however I need not mention any of this to my family, for it only causes

          more concern and depression." </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Several groups

          of mill workers joined a Union and striked, however the mill owners

          destroyed the Unions. They fired the Union workers and blacklisted them.

          Just like the textile worker strike in September of 34. "We know we

          are treated unfairly, however, we must think of the other over 150,000

          unemployed North Carolinians and their families suffering and in despair."

          "I just hope this ends soon for I dread we will not be able to make

          it through this era of suffering much longer." </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Jacksons are

          not the only family suffering in this community, many other West Durham

          Cotton Mill workers are experiencing the same misfortunes. The only

          thing these men and women can do now is to be strong and pray this time

          of suffering shall end soon. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you should meet

          Josephine Wallace you would more than likely say to yourself, "With

          a little more 'finish' she'd be a good-looking woman." She has a high

          forehead, well-shaped nose and mouth, and nice blue eyes. She keeps

          abreast of the styles--perhaps a little too well--and she is never without

          a permanent wave. Although she has worked in a cotton mill a good part

          of her life she does not look more than her forty years. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The ambition of

          Josephine's life is to keep her five children, more particularly her

          two daughters, out of the mill. She does not mind the hard work she

          does each day because it is to provide advantages for her children.

          She is making seventeen dollars a week and her husband twenty-two. They

          apparently dread the impending wage out more than some families of lesser

          means because they hate to curtail in any measure the standard of living

          they have worked out for their family. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you should go

          to the Wallace home in all probability you would be greeted by one of

          Josephine's neatly dressed and well-mannered children who would enter

          into conversation with you as soon as you were both seated in the living-room.

          The living room is a cheerful, homey place despite the misapplication

          of color and the lack of taste in choice of ornaments. The door prop

          is a big china cat which curls itself in indolent laziness and manages

          to gaze at you no matter where you are seated. The mantel is adorned

          with two miniature covered wagons, one polar bear, a cat group, and

          a china center piece which features a little girl looking at a dog and

          asking, "Can't you talk?" Wherever you turn in the room you are likely

          to see a gaudy-looking piece of statuary but in a little while you do

          not mind. Even the too much greenness of the flowered rug which is vying

          with the colorful drapery ceases to annoy you. Inevitably you reach

          the conclusion that the people who live here have created for themselves

          a home. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Wallaces are

          congenial among themselves and they find friends who share their interest

          in music. The bad-toned piano is the pride of the household. If Ira

          Belle, the 17 year old daughter, were to come in during your visit whe

          would ask you if you could play certain tunes and with a request that

          she play them for you should would respond readily. She might play Tippy-Tippy-Ten,

          a number or two from Snow White, several others from recent pictures,

          and almost certainly Duke University's song. Ira Belle will take from

          the music rack a number of hymn-books and hand them to you for your

          inspection. Among them will be a compilation by Gypsy Smith, a favorite

          of hers. Her grand-father Carrington who was born in England has told

          her that when he was a lad he ran away from home and lived for a while

          with the gypsy tribe to which Gypsy Smith belonged. When you put the

          books aside Ira Belle will play for you a number of hymns which she

          and members of her family have sung in duet and quartet combinations

          at the local churches during revivals. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Wallace children

          are proud of their mother and father. Josephine has told her children

          that their father traces his ancestry back to the Wallace clan that

          saved the Crown of Scotland, and that gives the two girls a certain

          feeling of security as they attend the Durham High School. Ira Belle

          thinks that many more of the mill girls would go on through high school

          if they were not made to feel inferior by classmates who have had superior

          advantages. The past year she was secretary of her section, in which,

          as she expresses it "All the girls were nice, smart girls and none of

          them high falutin'." Both of the girls say that Josephine has always

          seen to it that they were as neatly dressed as anybody in their classes.

          </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One point of pride

          with Josephine's children is the fact that their father who had very

          little grade school education passed a correspondence course dealing

          with arithmetic. Josephine herself went through the seventh grade because

          a certain security in her home made it necessary for her to start to

          work until she was fourteen. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Josephine Wallace

          is the oldest of five children born to David and Josephine Carrington.

          David, one of six children, was born in Bidston, Cheshire County, England.

          His father, a watchmaker and diamond setter, sent him to grade school

          from the time he was three until he was eleven. At eleven he entered

          Brassie's Shipyard and worked until he was fifteen. Joining the English

          navy then he served for eight years and came out a skilled mechanic.

          Service had brought him to the Atlantic Coast of the United States and

          in David's words he had become a "free-thinker and wanted to spend the

          rest of his days in the United States. England in those days was too

          conservative for me." Shortly thereafter, having made his way to North

          Carolina, he met and married Josephine Smith who lived in the backwoods

          country near Sanford. Josephine had to her credit only six months of

          schooling. Her father had come home from the War between the States

          crippled with arthritis and unable to do manual labor at all. His girls

          worked hard on the small farm which he owned and managed to subsist

          in a meager sort of way. David's skill as a mechanic, when a skilled

          mechanic was hard to find, made it possible for him to keep a job and

          make Josephine's life a little easier than it had been. Soon after he

          was married his pay was increased from seventy-five cents to a dollar

          and a quarter a day. When he told Josephine the good news she exclaimed

          "My Lord, that makes us rich folks for sure." She says that no money

          has ever made her prouder than that first week's wages with the raise

          for it seemed such a big amount after the lean., hard days she'd known

          on the farm. From then on David made a fairly decent living for his

          family and by the year 1912 he had a small bank account. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At that time letters

          from England reminded him that his mother was ageing fast and her health

          was failing. David could not overcome the desire to see his mother again.

          He sold all of his property except his household goods and with his

          wife and three children went to England. After a month's visit among

          his people, David and his family returned to North Carolina on the Aquitania.

          </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Shortly after his

          return David secured a job as a mill mechanic in West Durham and he

          has been there since. Josephine as the oldest of the children felt the

          need of contributing to the family at an earlier age than the others.

          Then, too, all the girls of her age that she knew had entered the mill.

          Her younger brothers and sisters attained the age of fifteen before

          their life in the mill began. One of her brothers is married to a nurse

          and one of her sisters whose husband owns two houses in Asheville is

          supervisor in a cigarette factory in Richmond. The other brother and

          sister are married and working in the same mill with Josephine. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Josephine is proud

          of her father and mother. She likes to tell you that the older Josephine,

          now sixty-one, got another permanent last week. She will look at the

          large photograph of her which stands on the piano, and say "That's a

          good picture but lot of folks have told me they didn't think it done

          mama justice." If her father's name is brought into the conversation

          she will probably tell that he is a thirty-second degree Mason. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Josephine's ambition

          for her children is hardly more pronounced than is her husband's. He

          is determined to educate his children so that they may make a living

          of which they will not be ashamed. Though Tom Wallace's father became

          Chief of Police of Burlington before his death, the older ones of his

          seven children knew many hard days and were glad of a chance to work

          in the mill when they were no more than ten or eleven years old. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Wallaces have

          not saved any money during their married life but they have provided

          their children with a respectable home. If Josephine's health holds

          out and the mill continues to need them both they plan to send all their

          children through high school and to give the two girls business training

          to equip them for the profession of court stenographer. </font>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Down in Monkey
          Bottoms in a small four-room house there lives a family of four women,
          two men, and four children. The house in which they live is typical
          of the houses in this section of the mill village. Monkey Bottoms begins
          with a washed-out, hilly road, flanked on one side by closely-placed
          and disorderly-looking houses and on the other by a jumbled growth of
          hedge, scrubby trees, and briars. The road leads down into, a bottom
          and meets at right angles another road of like kind. The houses, of
          the second road, all located on its right side, maintain the same unlikely
          appearance. These two roads with their houses comprise Monkey Bottoms.
          </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the particular
          house already mentioned Haithcocks, Ways, Fosters, and Piners live in
          dreary confusion. One small room into which two beds are crowded serves
          in the daytime as a place for tagging tobacco sacks. The little available
          floor place is littered with strings and tags. Freida Haithcock and
          Hulda Foster sit in this room hours at a time, both fortified by a generous
          quantity of snuff, tagging the tiny sacks and dreaming of the day when
          they will again have a job in the mill. Together they share a tin can
          spittoon which is obligingly shifted from one to the other as the need
          arises. Flies swarm thickly about the poorly screened house and hunt
          out the bread crumbs scattered by the three oldest children. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The walls give
          one the impression that some member of the mixed family has made calendar
          collecting a pastime. Over the mantelpiece enlarged pictures of departed
          relatives hang crookedly against the wall. On the mantelpiece, the central
          feature is a large picture entitled "Christ in Gethsemane Praying."
          On one side of the picture stands a blue and silver tinselled combination
          with the words, "Book of Life; Is My Name Written There," and on the
          other, a simply framed assurance, "Jesus Never Fails." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This household
          grew around four of Perry Haithcocks' daughters, three of whom are now
          living. Perry, a tenant farmer, was the father of ten children. Their
          life on the farm was dull and hard and empty of promise. Perry felt
          that the cotton mill offered his family a slightly better chance than
          the farm had ever given. He took his ten children to the mill, and as
          soon as it would have them he put them to work. Of this crowd none went
          further than the third grade in school. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The youngest of
          the Haithcocks, Clara, is now twenty-five. It fell to her lot after
          her mother's death to stay at home and keep house. When the time arrived
          for her to go to work there was no job for her. Now a slovenly and disgruntled
          person, she stays on with the three of her sisters whom circumstances
          have kept together. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The daughter second
          to the youngest married Evart Piner and they began housekeeping in Monkey
          Bottoms. She died at the birth of her first baby, and soon after her
          death, not quite a year ago, her sister, Effie Way, with her husband
          and three children came to Evart Piner's house to live. The mill at
          which they worked had closed with no prospects of reopening in the near
          future and they hoped to secure work in Durham. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After weeks of
          waiting Effie was given a job and she now makes $16 a week. Her husband
          Tom has not found work yet and his health is such that it is problematical
          whether he will ever hold a job again. Kidney trouble, high blood pressure,
          and asthma, make it necessary for him to go to the doctor two or three
          times monthly. Effie comes home from the mill tired and irritable and
          she quarrels with her children so much that they have learned to treat
          with contempt the threats she makes against them. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The fourth sister,
          Freida, had been living with the Piners before the Ways moved in. Freida
          has had pneumonia three times and typhoid fever twice. At thirty-six
          she sits like an old woman, stooped and sallow and wrinkled, as she
          tags the sacks for which she receives weekly a dollar and a half. Up
          until a year ago she was a spinner in the mill and drew $15.98 a week.
          Her health became so bad that she was forced to give up her job. Each
          time when she goes back now to ask the superintendent to reinstate her
          he tells her that he is unable to make a place for her. Should he give
          her work it is doubtful that she could keep it, for she still goes twice
          a week to Watts Hospital to receive treatment. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Evart Piner, the
          only member of the household except Effie Way who is working, makes
          fourteen dollars a week. Out of that he pays board to his sisters-in-law
          for himself and young baby. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Besides the three
          sisters Effie Way, Clara and Freida Haithcock, the two brothers-in-law,
          Clarence Way and Evart Piner, the three Way children and the Piner baby,
          there is in the same house Hulda Foster. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hulda was left
          an orphan at fifteen and she came to live with her neighbors, the Haithcocks.
          One senses in a little while that to Hulda the household owes whatever
          semblance of order there may be. At ten she went to work in the Belmont
          mills and there the rest of her childhood was spent. She tells you how
          glad she was as a little girl to hear the six o'clock mill whistle in
          the afternoons because it meant that as soon as she had eaten supper
          her playtime would begin. The hours from six-thirty until eight-thirty
          were her own. Tired as she might be from her ten hours of work she was
          not too tired to join the other children of the neighborhood in their
          games. As she grew out of childhood there was no form of recreation
          to take the place of those play hours. The sound of the mill became
          the one rhythm to which her life was attuned. She says that ever since
          she has been without a job she has missed the hum of machinery almost
          as much as she has missed the money with which to buy her food. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hulda lost her
          job when the Haw River mill closed. She was then living with the Ways
          and she moved with them to Durham. A good spinner and a hard worker,
          she had high hopes of securing a job. A year of unemployment has dimmed
          her hopes somewhat, but hardship has not yet made her bitter. She sits
          there, unlettered but not unintelligent, tagging tobacco sacks, while
          with a quiet concentration she prays for the one thing life has not
          yet given her -- work. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even though Hulda
          is unable to contribute financially to this confused family, one feels
          that she gives to it something which keeps it from sinking lower than
          its present depth. There is quiet humor in her eyes as she says "Yes,
          we eat beans and potatoes and hardboiled cabbage mostly. Most cotton
          mill folks is a fool about beans but here in this family they aint one
          of us that cabbage agrees with." She talks on in an effort to keep you
          from noticing too much the loud, coarse voice of Effie Way who, in the
          adjoining room, is quarreling with her children. Effie's wrangling makes
          the house seem dirtier and more confused than before. Hulda and Freida
          both look at the tin can spittoon and Hulda oblingingly passes it to
          Freida. After a while Freida speaks in a sickly, whining voice. "Time
          was when the mill was always needin' hands and a job was no trouble
          atall to git." Awed a little by the sound of her own voice she looks
          at Hulda who nods her head in support. In a manner more decisive than
          Freida's Hulda reaches her hand for another sack. </font>

          July 15, 1938 </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It was about two
          o'clock in the afternoon and Mary was still busy with her dinner dishes.
          She asked me to come back to her kitchen, and there I met her oldest
          daughter, Janie, who was with her mother for a two weeks visit. Mary
          continued washing dishes while Janie, after rinsing them in a pan of
          hot water, dried them. The kitchen was clean and orderly and the least
          disturbing of all the rooms in the house in which to sit. I was glad
          that Mary after finishing with the dishes did not suggest that we go
          into another room. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I had been told
          that Mary was ill and I expected to find her in bed. When I asked her
          about her health she replied, "Yes, I'm sick with diabetes most of the
          time but I try to stay up as much as I can. The doctors at Duke are
          treating me and I go in twice a week when I'm able. They tell me my
          body is suffering from the brutish treatment I've give it all my life.
          If they mean work I reckin I have done as much as the next one." Then
          Mary told me her story. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary Smith was
          born in Orange County fifty-seven years ago. Her father was a renter
          and he found it difficult to support his eight children on what was
          left after the landlord was paid. Not that the children didn't lend
          a helping hand. Mary cannot remember when she did not contribute her
          quota of work-hours toward her own support. At six she stood up in a
          chair to wash the dishes and prepare the scanty meals for cooking while
          her mother labored in the fields. There were then three smaller children
          who required the time left over from housekeeping duties. As she grew
          older there seemed no way to make a little time for school. She thinks
          that reading must indeed be a great pleasure. Many times she has picked
          up a book and sat with it in her hands wishing that she might know what
          was inside its pages. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When she was eleven
          the family income was supplemented by group participation in a relatively
          new industry. Smoking tobacco was gaining in popularity and the manufacturers
          of the product needed many small bags in which to pack it for distribution.
          The bag factories which grew up in answer to this need sent the bags
          out by the thousands into the surrounding countryside to be strung and
          tagged. During periods of slack in farm work Mary and her young brother
          walked the five miles into Durham and took back to their home two large
          sacks, each containing ten thousand small bags. She can remember sitting
          up all night on occasion during the rush season, each member of the
          family working as hard as he could to string these sacks for which they
          received thirty cents a thousand. When sleep laid such a heavy claim
          on her that she felt she could no longer stand it her mother sent her
          out on the back porch to dash cold water on her face that she might
          keep her eyes open yet a little longer. The year she was twelve her
          skill increased so that she raised the family income by several dollars,
          and her parents out of appreciation of her industry bought her two percale
          dresses instead of one. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the time she
          was fifteen years old her father had decided his family would have a
          better living at a cotton mill than they could ever make for themselves
          on another man's farm. They sold the mule and the cow but they kept
          the twenty-six chickens for a while after moving to town. The nice fresh
          eggs came in handy because wages weren't so high that such things could
          be bought in plenty. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary began work
          at twenty-five cents a day. Her hours were from six to six but she will
          tell you that she doesn't believe the twelve hours then were any harder
          than eight hours now what with the speed-up system they have. Her man
          Jim comes in clean wore out at the end of a day, but of course she knows
          he's not a young man any longer. In fact, his working days are almost
          over because he's not so far from sixty and his body is none too stout.
          </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When she married
          at eighteen she was making four dollars a week and Jim four dollars
          and a half. If it hadn't been for the installment plan she wonders if
          they ever could have bought the two beds and stove with which they began
          housekeeping. Nighttimes Jim made four chairs and a table. With so much
          furniture in their house they decided to take a couple of boarders to
          help with the installments still to be paid. The furniture wasn't more
          than paid for when Mary had to have an operation which cost Jim fifty
          dollars. That was three momths before her first baby was born and another
          baby was on its way before the debt was finally paid. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sometimes when
          her health was too bad to work in the mill Mary took up her old occupation
          of stringing bags. The wage had increased to fifty cents a thousand
          and with steady use of her spare time she could do a thousand a day.
          In the course of time five children were born to Mary Smith and four
          of them managed to live past babyhood. Mary's last child was born in
          1912. It didn't live but three days and the Smiths had to borrow the
          money to bury it. "That year was one of the hardest in my life," Mary
          told me that afternoon. "The doctor started comin' to see me in early
          May and there wasn't a day from then on until the middle of September
          that he didn't come to our house. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As soon as I was
          out of bed Jim took sick with the typhoid fever and for six solid weeks
          he wasn't able to work. Two of the younguns took the fever from him.
          If we couldner got credit we woulder starved. It was many a year before
          we ever caught up again. We was in such bad shape that the two younguns
          was forced to go in the mill though I'd hoped to keep 'em out until
          they'd had a little more chance for schoolin'." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The oldest boy
          entered the mill at twelve and the oldest girl at thirteen. The boy
          has been there since except for sick leaves in the past few years when
          he has been bothered with hemorrhages of the lung. He was such a scrawny,
          pale, little fellow that many a time when Mary went to rouse him on
          a cold winter morning she felt like turning away from the bed and letting
          him rest through the day. But she knew he might lose his job, and the
          money he made was badly needed. Sometimes now she wonders if his health
          wouldn't have held out better if she could have kept him out of the
          mill a few years longer until his body had been given more chance to
          grow. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This son married
          after thirty and he has three children, all too young to work, and a
          wife whose health is so poor she cannot work. He was brought home from
          the mill with another hemorrhage the other day and Mary is wondering
          how she can help him. It seems to her that the fourteen dollars a week
          Jim is making cannot be stretched over another need. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary paused at
          this point in her story and sat with her hands folded in her lap. Janie
          looked first at her mother and then at me. "If it hadn't been for Mama
          my younguns wouldner had no clothes atall the past year," she said.
          "The mill where my husband works aint give its help but four days' work
          a week in over a year. Tom makes eleven dollars and its all I can do
          to feed, let along cloths, my crowd on that. "My children is pretty
          good about not complainin'. They'll set down one day right after another
          to dried beans and potatoes without raisin' a row. Of course, that oldest
          one has got all manner of pride and she caused me a sight of trouble
          for awhile when she had to wear a old coat to school that never fit
          her nowhere. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"The worst hurt
          I ever seen her, though, was along 'bout the last of school when her
          teacher tried to collect rent for the school books she'd been usin'
          all the year. I thought the State was furnishin' 'em free but they say
          everybody is supposed to pay rent on 'em. Emma Lee kept after me but
          I never had the money to give her. One day she broke down in school
          and cried and told her teacher they wasn't a penny at her home to pay
          for book rent. The teacher told her to stop worryin' then, and she never
          bothered her any more. Emma Lee says she's not goin' to stop until she
          goes clear on through high school." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Janie's four-year-old
          child came into the kitchen and propped herself against her grandmother's
          knee. Mary put her arm about the child and seemed to forget for a while
          that she was there. "Well, she'll have plenty time to go through high
          school since the mill can't take 'em until they are sixteen or eighteen,
          I don't know which," she said. "Of course it's hard to say if things
          keep on like they are who's goin' to furnish the money. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"It's been a funny
          thing about my own family," she continued. "Pa didn't have a single
          child that wasn't willin' to work to try to get ahead and they aint
          a one of us that's got anything today. They aint never been a time when
          one was havin' trouble that the others was able to help him out of the
          bog. They's three of us livin' now. One of my brothers whose wife died
          last year is gettin' just two day's work a week and him with eight children.
          I don't know how on earth he's livin'. The other brother is makin' $8
          a week and he has four children at home. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"This is my pet,"
          Mary continued, changing the subject abruptly as she drew the child
          closer to her. "She come over a week before her Ma did and I never heard
          a whimper out of her." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Is she the next
          to the youngest?" I asked, addressing Janie. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No'm, there's
          two younger than her," Janie answered. "My lap baby is just three months
          old and the knee baby in yonder room with her is two year old." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Six children and
          her thirty-three," Mary said. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"That's more children
          than a working man can take care of" I ventured. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A queer sort of
          smile flitted across Janie's face and she lowered her head. Presently
          she looked up at me and said slowly, "You are right about that." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before I left,
          all of Janie's children had been in the kitchen. The oldest girl, twelve,
          looked pale and undernourished. Two of the younger ones played about
          with a great deal of energy. They would be considered pretty in any
          average group of children and as I looked across at Janie I wondered
          how it could be. At thirty-three she is fat, sallow, and unkempt with
          a look of forty-five at its worst about her face and figure. Good-naturedly
          she watches her children at play and thinks no further than the next
          feeding of her small baby. Mary, clean and not unattractive, smiles
          with patient affection at her daughter and her grandchildren. She has
          a capacity for thinking ahead that Janie seems not to have. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary looks back
          over her past life and can see in it no period in which she might have
          saved for the days that are ahead. She will tell you that she has on
          occasion spent a little money for foolish pleasure but she wonders if
          a person could stand all the ups and downs of life without giving over
          now and then to foolish things. Occupying a prominent position on her
          mantel in the front room is a rose-colored goddess edged in green, propping
          itself against a green scooped-out tray which serves miscellaneous uses.
          She bought it for herself at the fair about ten years ago and she's
          still proud of it. In no less conspicuous places in her front room are
          framed pictures of the Rock of Ages; Jesus, the Savior; and a bordered
          motto of her missionary society. A good many of her extra quarters have
          gone through the channel of the church to help the heathen in foreign
          lands to a better way of life. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">She faces sixty
          with assets spent and liabilities yet to be reckoned with. Her chief
          asset in life has been her capacity for labor and from that, the one
          material asset she has saved for herself is something like two hundred
          dollars worth of furniture. The mill can no longer use her and she knows
          that Jim's days of usefulness are numbered. There has been talk on the
          hill in recent months about old age benefits. All that Mary understands
          out of that talk is that when Jim is sixty-five he will begin to draw
          a little money. She says it isn't reasonable the amount will be enough
          to keep them both. Actually Jim will draw with interest the 1.5% of
          his wage saved for him and matched by his employer during his work years
          beginning with 1936. If his fast-failing health will permit him to serve
          the mill for two more years he will consider that nothing but luck is
          carrying him on. He will be sixty-one then with only four more years
          to go before he starts collecting his old age benefits which with care
          would last him about six months. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Just before I left
          Mary's house she looked out of her kitchen window and across the hill.
          For awhile no one spoke and the hum of the mill was the only sound to
          be heard in the room. When Mary began to talk it was as if she thought
          that Janie and I, too, must have been thinking with her on the growth
          of the mill. "Yonder mill want one-tenth the size it is now when I first
          come here forty-two year ago," she said. "It seems like me and Jim's
          got old with the mill but age aint hurt the mill none. When it slows
          down it can git new parts and we caint. What's worse we soon aint goin'
          to have money to buy rations for feeding our wore-out bodies. The mill
          keeps makin' money but it has to give to them that's young and strong,
          I reckon, and even to them it caint give a regular livin'." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mary would like
          to have a little place of her own on the edge of town where she might
          raise a garden, and small patches, along with chickens, hogs and a cow
          -- especially a cow. She knows the country can be hard, bitter hard,
          because she hasn't forgotten when she was six years old. But then she
          was working for the other fellow and she believes it would be different
          if the land and house were hers. Nobody knows better than Mary that
          such thoughts are but an idle dream. She says that all her life she
          has known nothing but half-living and she expects no miracle when her
          days of usefulness are behind her. She does wonder sometimes what kind
          of a life lies before her children and grandchildren. </font>

          the mother of thirteen children, three of whom are dead and three married.
          Seven of the children ranging from two and a half to eighteen live with
          their mother and father in an old, four-room, loosely-built house located
          a short distance from the houses belonging to the company which owns
          the mill where John Dunne works. Some of the people in the mill village
          will tell you that the Dunnes were asked to move off the hill because
          the near-by neighbors discovered that their coal was disappearing at
          night; others will tell you that they did not take proper care of the
          company's house. At any rate the Dunnes cannot rent a company house
          and they pay $13 a month for the dilapidated one in which they live.
          It is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find a house of any
          kind because there have been months when the rent was not paid. John
          Dunne makes fourteen dollars a week and on that the family of nine must
          live. </font>

          out on the back porch." One of them runs ahead of you into the house
          and you walk uneasily through the confusion which is their home. The
          first two rooms are crowded with dirty beds and a few shabby chairs.
          The bedroom on the right contains a dusty table and a dustier radio.
          You look at the dirty floor and your mind is brought back to the fact

          are helping her tag tobacco sacks. Her unwieldy body bulges over the
          sides of her chair and an enormous tumor gives her the appearance of
          permanent pregnancy. She tells one of the children to get up and give
          you his chair. She waits for you to speak and when you have made some
          introductory remark she says "I keep alookin' toward you but I can't
          hardly see you. They aint no sight atall in one eye and the sight in
          the other is gettin' dimmer fast." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">She speaks of her
          blindness in a tone of such complete acceptance that you do not know
          what to say. You look into the dining room at the crude, home-made table
          with its ugly oilcloth and then at the icebox which is the other piece
          of furniture in the room. You decide to ask Sally about her work and
          soon she is telling you that she and the children tag 20,000 of the
          sacks a week and for it they receive $1.53. "It seems like that money
          goes further than John's wages," she continues. Sometimes we use it
          for clothes and now and again we buy somethin' foolish which I reckin
          we ought to get along without. I buy the "Durham Sun" for the children
          and it costs 15 a week, but they do love to read the funnies." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As Sally goes on
          to tell you of her early life you decide that even if her eyes were
          strong the paper she takes for the children would interest her very
          little as reading matter. She had time to go no further than the third
          grade, for her public work-life started at ten. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sally was born
          in Arkansas on a 160 acre farm belonging to her grandfather, Josiah
          White. As a young man Josiah was a tenant farmer in Durham County and
          after he was married he moved to Mississippi, hoping to find there such
          conditions as would give him a chance to become in time a land-owner.
          Believing, after two years of hard labor, that possibilities of his
          becoming a land-owner in that State were remote he moved with his wife
          and one child into Arkansas. No other children were born to him and
          by the time his daughter, Molly, mother of Sally, was eighteen he had
          paid for his 160 acre farm and furnished it with live stock. Molly married
          a neighboring tenant who then came to live with her on her father's
          place. When he died eight years later he left Molly with Sally and three
          younger children. It was not long until Josiah died and his widow, after
          selling the farm and stock for $1,300, returned to North Carolina. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Near a bag factory
          in East Durham Molly's mother bought a four-room house for herself and
          Molly's family. While the grandmother looked after the three smaller
          children Molly went into the mill. She took Sally, then an energetic
          child of ten, along and found work for her at twenty-five cents a day.
          Molly made around fifty cents daily and on the combined wages of mother
          and child the family subsisted. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sally had worked
          a long time before she was sixteen. When she reached that age she felt
          that life must indeed be half over. Work without any sort of recreation
          always had been her lot and marriage appeared to offer at least one
          advantage -- change. Child bearing began immediately and with it even
          more responsibility and less time for thoughts of recreation. It seems
          foolish to her today that grown people should want to go to ball games
          and picture shows. Her dislike of billiard parlors is pronounced but
          not nearly so much as her fear of liquor stores. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before she has
          finished with her remarks about liquor stores it is obvious that John
          goes to the one just down the street a little too often. "If John was
          to get drunk and get himself arrested the company would fire him," Sally
          tells you in affirmation of what you are already thinking. She says
          that she has not forgotten the two months not more than six years ago
          when John was out of work and there was not so much as a dollar to buy
          the children food. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The mill at which
          John Dunne then worked was closed suddenly but it took the workmen some
          time to realize that the shut-down could be permanent. After two weeks
          John started on a trek through North and South Carolina to look for
          a job. Sally had gotten up early and made bread from the last dust of
          flour, and fried the last egg. John looked at the table and turned away.
          "I aint hungry" he said. "I'll leave what's there for the younguns."
          Sally sat there alone in the kitchen long after he had gone. She knew
          John was hungry. She knew, too, that his mind was miserable with doubt.
          He didn't know whether there was any job ahead of him and he didn't
          know how his family would get food. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Suddenly Sally
          stops speaking and a smile lights up her ugly face. With an abrupt jesture
          of her right hand she pushes her hair further up under the bonnet-like
          cap shading her eyes. Then she says, "We had neighbors close by who
          was workin' at another mill but my mind wasn't on neighbors that morning
          John left. I just kept settin' there while the little bit of breakfast
          got colder and colder. Then all of a sudden I heard a knockin' on the
          kitchen door. When I opened the door and seen about a dozen folks standin'
          there with their arms full of groceries I couldn't help but cry. Well,
          John stayed gone a month and they wasn't a day we didn't have at least
          one meal. He come back without a job and it was a good month before
          he got one at another mill in Durham. Them was hard, hard times. I was
          needin' cover that winter but they wasn't a chance to save ahead for
          it." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">You know that any
          comment you might make would sound trivial. The silence gets deep and
          is broken only when a young woman you did not know lived here comes
          out of the house leading her two-year old baby. The child, dressed in
          a sunsuit, laughs gleefully as her mother puts him out in the yard to
          play. The woman sits down on a box in the corner of the porch and begins
          to smoke a cigarette. "That's my daughter Stella," Sally tells you and
          then adds "Her and her man both is out of work and they're stayin' with
          us a while." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella is drawn
          into the conversation and it is not long before she has told you of
          the furniture she tried to buy. When she and Bill were first married
          they selected a bedroom suite, a cedar chest, an upholstered chair,
          two linoleums, and a big fine oil stove. When she first saw the bedroom
          suite marked at $39.50, she thought it must really be the greatest bargain
          in town. When, after the sale was made, the proprietor began adding
          carrying charges which brought the price up to $61 she was a little
          baffled, but he explained to her just how easy the payments could be
          made. The bill for the furniture came to $200 and she and Bill had paid
          all of it but $80 at the time they lost their jobs. She doesn't see
          yet why they couldn't let her keep at least the bedroom suite. The subject
          of furniture is soon passed over and Stella tells you why she lost her
          job. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella lost her
          job when new spinning machinery was installed. The spinners retained
          were given eight sides instead of seven with a pay increase of two dollars
          a week. That sum was the regular wage paid heretofore for the operation
          of one of the old frames. The new Long Draft Machinery has around two
          hundred spindles and the old spinning frame contained 112 spindles.
          Stella has a friend still working who says she had never dreamed that
          eight hours of work could be so hard. Once she was able to catch up
          with her work and enjoy ten or fifteen-minute rest periods throughout
          the day, but since the installation of the Long Draft Machinery she
          stays continuously behind as much as fifteen or twenty minutes. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella's husband
          lost out when the doffers were asked to sign a paper stating that they
          were willing to do more work. Out of the sixteen then employed eight
          signed and they immediately began doing the work of all. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella and her
          husband have been living for the past six weeks on the unemployment
          insurance which they drew and will continue to draw for ten more weeks
          if their unemployment continues. They have spent a considerable part
          of it travelling from mill to mill in hope of finding a job. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stella looks out
          into the yard where her baby is playing with her young sisters and brothers.
          "I hope I don't never have another one," she says. "I had a miscarriage
          from lifting a heavy tub of water when he wasn't more than a year old.
          I went to the doctor and asked him what a woman could do to keep from
          havin' babies. I'm tryin' to do what he told me." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A child runs through
          the house and says that he sees his sister, Sue, coming down the street.
          He leaves the screen door ajar and Stella reprimands him for it though
          there are plenty of holes through which any fly might find his way inside.
          </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sue with her two
          children arrive and you are told that she is another of Sally's married
          daughters. She lives with her husband in the near-by mill village. Her
          hair-style, voice, and mannerisms show a marked resemblance to Betty
          Boop. You begin to feel that Sally's prejudice against movies is not
          shared by her children. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sue's two children,
          dressed in sunsuits, go out into the yard to play with Stella's baby.
          The two sisters discuss the amount of milk the doctor has prescribed
          for their children and indicate by their conversation that they try
          to meet the requirements. In the meantime you knock at flies. "I declare,
          I bathe that youngun every night before I put him to bed," Stella is
          saying "but he does get awful dirty." Sally joins in to say that she
          dreads Wednesday and Saturday nights because on those two nights all
          of the smaller children take their bathe and they make a great commotion
          dragging the tin tub back and forth from the porch to the kitchen where
          the bathing is done. You look out into the yard at Sally's children
          and decide that they do appear cleaner than the house to which they
          belong. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sue mentions her
          grandmother, Molly, and when you manifest an interest in her Sally tells
          you that Molly still lives in the small house which she inherited when
          her mother died. With her are her unmarried son and her divorced daughter,
          who is the mother of two children. The son is a loom fixer with a weekly
          wage of $22.00. He not only supports his mother but also contributes
          toward the support of his youngest sister's family when her wage as
          part-time worker in a silk mill cannot meet their needs. Molly's fourth
          child married a tenant farmer and they have no children. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After a while you
          leave the over-crowded house of the Dunnes and as you go along you recall
          other things that Sally has told you. Into your mind there come certain
          conclusions as to how she feels toward her own problems. </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With full awareness
          that her husband's wage can never cover the needs and can hardly touch
          the wants of her family, she is on the alert for any donations from
          the outside. She'd like for some of the older children at home to start
          working in the mill but since the mill cannot use them and the outside
          world does not need them she has been brought to the attitude that various
          organizations will have to help her with her problems. Her children
          had been attending the Methodist Church for a number of years but the
          kindness of the Baptist preacher at Christmas time last year converted
          them to the Baptist way of thinking. Sally says "There wouldner been
          any Christmas at this house if that man hadn't took a interest in providin'
          for my younguns. He brought a big goods box of things to us and I ain't
          never been much happier than when I was unpacking it. They was apples,
          oranges, candy, nuts, tops, dolls, trains, and little wagons -- plenty
          to divide amongst them still believing in Santa Claus." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The teacher which
          she likes best is the one who last winter bought her twelve-year old
          son a pair of shoes after he had been absent from school for three weeks
          on account of the cold weather. She hopes that by next year the school
          will furnish free lunches for the children and eliminate her problem
          of providing three meals a day. If you should manifest any interest
          in how she manages to provide food for her crowd, her characteristic
          answer is, "Every head I've got would go hungry if I didn't keep peas
          aboilin' in the pot all the time." </font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With continual
          acceptance of unsolved problems Sally has reached a state of lethargy
          which she does not or cannot disturb. There seems to be no appreciable
          effort to train her children in the tasks about the house. After the
          Dunnes have eaten, some of the children will wash the dishes in a hasty
          and slip-shod manner and then join the rest of the family in one of
          the two dirty bedrooms where the $12 radio is turned on at full-blast.
          Some of the children are good looking and as a group appear of average
          intelligence. With no direction of their energies they play a little,
          scrap a little, and live from meal to meal while Sally sits among them,
          usually holding a tobacco sack which she is tagging without being able
          to see it very well. </font>
