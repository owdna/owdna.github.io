    of Broad Street (south of the railroad tracks) was Monkey Top and Monkey
    Bottom. Here, Dewey and Nettie Carden stand in front of their home at

    escaped from their cage at nearby Erwin Auditorium were never found).</p>
</div>

<div style="font-style: italic;">
  <p>&quot;I lived for many years in Monkey Bottom, between Swift<br>
    Avenue and Erwin Field. I trudged through the woods to<br>
    Campus Drive and caught rides to class sometimes. We<br>
    bought groceries from Mrs. Jackson, a dignified<br>
    Christian lady of seventy-five who sold a few things<br>
    in one room of her three-room house. Some of us would<br>
    try new items when her welfare checks got screwed up,<br>
    or when the rent went up on her, or when the wholesale<br>
    house quit selling half-cases and only sold whole<br>
    cases of things. Or when it was cold. She makes<br>
    home-made butter, and buttermilk, and she gave us<br>
    collard greens and turnips from her garden. She used a<br>
    crutch and had bad arthritis; and she always hugged<br>
    us, even when we were really hairy.</p>

  <p>I remember how hard it was for her when the city [at<br>
    Duke's request] tore down a fourth of the houses in<br>
    Monkey Bottom. They had to move the route of the new<br>
    highway so a nursing home for rich but homeless old<br>
    people could be built. The houses got removed, the<br>
    others moved away out of Durham, and the lots waited<br>
    two years empty. They are empty now.</p>

  <p>Some students bought a Monkey Bottom house and fixed<br>
    it up very creatively. When they moved, they sold it<br>
    to Duke. Duke decided not to rent it to anybody. A<br>
    friend of mine stayed there for a while, but Duke<br>
    found out and tore the place down, to save taxes and<br>
    'prevent vandalism.' Duke gets all the houses it can<br>
    unless it runs out of money. The neighborhood was<br>
    re-zoned 'commercial' last summer. I forget why.&quot;<br>

<h3>Eckerd's Drug Store</h3>
<p><i>The following essay was submitted with the photograph by Laura McAllister
  on April 21, 1983.

<div class="imagebox">

  <p>Eckerd's Drugstore (with Broad Street gas station in background).</p>
</div>

<p>
  The first time I observed the other customers from my
  seat at the Eckerd's counter, I saw many different faces--some bored,
  some sad, none of them seemingly connected. But it wasn't long before
  I discerned that there is a group of regulars who frequent Eckerd's
  at various times throughout the day.
</p>

<p>
  These retired and semi-retired men come to Eckerd's
  not because of the food or ambiance, but out of a need to occupy themselves.
  At first this realization struck me as terribly sad because I saw nothing
  beyond the men's loneliness. But after having gotten to know them, I
  realized that they don't feel sorry for themselves; therefore, there
  was no reason for me to. These men live to the best of their ability.
  All who are physically able continue to work--Ralph at the mill, Ector
  for Duke Laundry, Riley at the Rock Shop. And whether they work or not,
  they plan their days. Woody watches a lot of television. Wimpy takes
  long walks. Ector goes fishing. Riley tends his garden.
</p>

<p>
  What ties these men together is the time they spend
  at Eckerd's. It is the only place in West Durham where they can sit
  down next to a familiar face and be greeted warmly by waitresses as
  loving as Dot and Kathryn.
</p>

<p>
  Yet despite the camaraderie shared among these men and
  the contentment with their lives illustrated in some of the pictures,
  there remains a sad element in the faces of the individuals that is
  also captured on film. Perhaps it is because their lives are slower
  paced than most that these men appear to feel and express more, whether
  the emotion be happy or sad. For whatever reason, elder people, much
  like children, possess a rich quality of expression which many of us
  seem to lack in our middle years.
</p>

<p>
  The mannerisms and characteristics of the men I photographed
  at Eckerd's fascinated me from the very beginning and getting to know
  them has been a joy. The photographs have been an additional reward.
