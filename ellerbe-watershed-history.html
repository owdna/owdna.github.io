<h2>The Pretty Rivulet: A History of the Ellerbe Watershed</h2>

		<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Text-Photos" -->
		  <p>From Allibay and
            Watery Branch to Pinhook and Allergy Creek, the history of Ellerbe and
            South Ellerbe creeks is long and colorful. During his 1701 trek through
            the wilderness of the Carolinas, John Lawson headed east from Occaneechi
            Town (near what is now Hillsborough). Lawson wrote of hiking 14 difficult
        miles, &quot;a sad stoney way,&quot; to the next village, called Adshusheer.</p>
		  <p>One local theory holds that Ellerbe Creek might have been &quot;the pretty rivulet&quot; that Lawson crossed -- just south of the Duke family's homestead in Durham County.</p>

		  <p>In the earliest
		    grants and on the earliest maps, Ellerbe Creek was spelled &quot;Allibay.&quot;
		      That spelling led a few scholars to theorize that Ellerbe might be of
		      Native American derivation. When the Europeans arrived, the North Carolina
		      Piedmont was dominated by Sioux-speakers such as the Eno, Occaneechi,
		      Saponi, Sissipahaw, Tutelo, and Shoccoree.</p>
		  <p>Different European
		    ears heard the Siouxan consonant that had a sound somewhere between
		    an R and an L. Thus, there is much speculation about Ellerbe Creek's
		    oldest name. In the days before standardized orthography, the creek
		    carried a variety of names including, Allibay, Allibay's, Eleby, Ellerbee,
		    Ellerbie, and Ellerbe (we use the state's spelling).</p>
		  <p>According to the The Colonial Records of North Carolina
		    (1886-90), John Ellerby (Allaby), who received land grants in what is
		    now Anson County, may have first taken up land in present Durham. Historian
		    Jean Anderson opines that Ellerbe Creek took it's name from that family.</p>
		  <p>In 1737, surveyors
		    traveled up from New Bern looking for &quot;the Enoe fork.&quot; The last creek
		    the surveyors found on the west side of the Neuse (before the Eno River)
		    was &quot;Deep Creek.&quot; Today, that stream is called Ellerbe Creek. </p>
		  <p>Before 1752, when
		    this territory was still part of Granville county, some landgrants referred
		    to Ellerbe Creek as &quot;South Eno.&quot; In the late 18th century, South Ellerbe
		    Creek was called &quot;Watery Branch.&quot;</p>

		  <p>The oldest landgrants
		    in this area were from the agents of Lord Granville. Almost all of the
		    several hundred Granville grants in old Orange county were on bottom
		    land along the major creeks and rivers (including less than a dozen
		    Granville grants on Ellerbe Creek). </p>

		  <div id="caption">1770 map showing Allabay's Creek (Ellerbe
		    today) in the middle. You can even see the two tributaries of South
		    Ellerbe -- one flowing through present-day Old West Durham and Walltown
		    and the other flowing north past what is now Durham Central Park, Trinity
		    Park, Old North Durham and Duke Park. The point where the Eno River
		    and Allabay meet is now under the waters of Falls Lake, in eastern Durham
		    County. (source: Collet's Map of North Carolina, ca. 1770.)</div>
		  <p>In the early days,
		    settlers avoided the inferior land in the Triassic Basin and gravitated
		    to the richer alluvium of the Haw valley and the upper Eno valley.</p>
		  <p>Ellerbe Creek-Goose
		    Creek in the Upper-Neuse basin and the New Hope Creek-Mud Creek-Sand
		    Creek- Third Fork Creek in the Cape Fear basin drain most of the Durham
		    portion of a 200-million-year-old sea bed.</p>
		  <p>Bennett Place,
		    site of the Civil War's largest troop surrender, is crossed by Ellerbe
		    feeders. James Bennitt's original deed mentions that his land was on
		    &quot;waters of New Hope Creek and Ellerbe Creek,&quot; meaning it was on both
		    sides of the ridge that divides the Neuse and Cape Fear watersheds.</p>

		  <p>Today,
		    the North Carolina Railroad crosses Durham following this ridge. To
		    the north of the tracks, all tributaries including Ellerbe creek and
		    its feeders flow past Raleigh, Smithfield, Goldsboro, Kinston, and New
		    Bern into Pamlico Sound. South of the tracks, the tributaries empty
		    into New Hope Creek -- eventually flowing into the Atlantic below Southport. </p>
		  <p>The paths of South
		    Ellerbe and Ellerbe follow the history of Durham itself. Several grist
		    mills and saw mills along its banks have disappeared from the records.
		    South Ellerbe was more Blue collar in its origins while Ellerbe held
		    more middle class origins. All these creeks flow through some of the
		    Bull City's most historic urban neighborhoods.</p>
		  <p>Old West Durham
		    was built for workers in the textile mills, Walltown for workers in
		    the tobacco industry, Watts-Hillandale for shop owners and doctors and,
		    Trinity Park for merchants and teachers at a new college which would
		    eventually changed its name to Duke University. </p>
		  <p>A number of springs
		    feed a number of little creeks that become South Ellerbe and Ellerbe
		    creeks. Ellerbe Creek begins its course west of Cole Mill Road and crosses
		    Hillandale Golf Course and the neighborhood of Watts-Hospital-Hillandale.
		    When Watts Hospital was moved to Broad Street from Trinity Park, many
		    doctors and merchants built their homes along West Club Boulevard (beginning
		    around 1908). </p>

		  <p>Ellerbe then flows
		    through areas that were forests and farms until the 1950s. Duke Homestead
		    was one of those farms and is now surrounded by housing developments
		    in what was a large green belt separating Durham and Bragtown. </p>
		  <p>South Ellerbe&acute;s
		    headwaters rise next to what was once the settlement of Pinhook, which
		    served as a traveler's rest on the dirt road between the colonial capital
		    of Hillsborough and and the new state capital of Raleigh. </p>
		  <p>In 1906, W.S Lockhart
		    wrote that Pinhook was, &quot;known as a place of brawls and rough-and-tumble
		    fights, drinking, gambling and other forms of amusement, where the natives
		    and visitors met to have a rough, roaring, and to them, glorious time.&quot;</p>
		  <p>Beginning near
		    Greystone Baptist on Hillsborough Road, South Ellerbe Creek flows for
		    three miles through some of Durham's oldest and most densely developed
		    neighborhoods. </p>
		  <p>Today, the first
		    mile of the creek is surrounded by various auto and muffler shops, large
		    surface parking lots, a plumbing shop, funeral home, photo studio, small
		    apartment complex, the Southern Railroad, Highway 70/Business, a Duke
		    warehouse, an old gas station, and a number of quiet back yards. Its
		    path will take it past three schools: EK Powe Elementary, Brogden Middle
		    and Club Boulevard Elementary. </p>
		  <p>In 1892, the Rigsbee
		    family sold a northern stretch of its farm to make room for the Erwin
		    Mills and some of the surrounding mill village near Ninth Street. Also
		    in 1892, Trinity College moved next door -- to Blackwell's Fairgrounds
		    (eventually becoming Duke's East Campus).</p>
		  <p>25 years later,
		    the rest of the Rigsbee farm was sold and became Duke's West Campus.
		    Duke's football stadium was built in the ravine where the Rigsbee's
		    kept their pigs (site of the 1942 Rose Bowl, moved to Durham after Pearl
		    Harbor). Many of the Italian stonecutters who built Duke Chapel and
		    the hospital lived in West Durham, near South Ellerbe. </p>

		  <p>Crossing the northern
		    edge of the old Erwin Cotton Mills, South Ellerbe Creek was channelized
		    and used to dump warm dyes from the mills. At the dawn of the new millennium,
		    many of the mill families still in Old West Durham simply call it the
		    &quot;ditch.&quot;</p>
		  <p>Long-time residents
		    of the mill village recall that a sawmill was placed in the middle of
		    the woods to cut the planks to build the first mill houses -- along
		    the creek. In the early days, the entire neighborhood smelled like a
		    Laundromat -- from the hot, soapy water being discharged by the textile mills into South Ellerbe.<a name="JDLEllerbee"></a> </p>
		  <p>Hall of Fame and
		    Grammy-award winning composer John D. Loudermilk (who wrote 'Tobacco
		    Road') grew up on the banks of South Ellerbe. During the Prohibition,
		    a house on Virgie Street was one of the most popular destinations in
		    all of West Durham. In the back yard were two doors. One was prominent
		    and led nowhere. A second was small and mostly hidden. Visitors would
		    pass through the smaller door to enter a large room filled with floor-to-ceiling
		    cabinets -- each with a small padlock. Inside the private cabinets was
		    a collection of favorite spirits. </p>
		  <p>According to long-time
		    residents, White Lightning was the brew of choice. Consumption only
		    allowed off-site. One resident recalls a scandalous morning in the 1930s
		    when a body was found in South Ellerbe Creek across the street. Scared
		    the neighborhood kids half to death. Turns out he was fine -- just an
		    avid consumer of local moonshine. Today, this area forms the heart of
		    the National Registry Historic District in Old West Durham and the proposed
		    site for an urban green space.</p>
		  <p>In the late 1880s,
		    a young African-American man named George Wall followed his job with
		    Trinity College to Durham. Wall bought a wooded plot of land just north
		    of what is now East Campus. Walltown became a neighborhood for workers
		    moving into the Bull City for the growing tobacco industry. The narrow
		    shotgun houses and small residences provided easy access to the tobacco
		    factories. The east-west streets were numbered and the north-south streets
		    were lettered (which explains why Ninth Street is called Ninth Street). </p>

		  <div id="caption">Earth
		    Day creek clean-up in Walltown Park.</div>
		  <p>From Walltown,
		    South Ellerbe Creek flows under Guess Road, the massive surface parking
		    lots at Northgate Mall, and Interstate 85. According to the Durham Architectural
		    and Historic Inventory, rapid growth during the 1950s, transformed the
		    forests and farmlands into neighborhoods like Northgate Park. </p>
		  <p>Another branch
		    of South Ellerbe flows north from downtown through Old North Durham
		    and Trinity Park --joining its sister streams near West Club Blvd Elementary.
		    After emerging from the downtown tobacco warehouse district, the creek
		    passes the old Pearl Cotton Mills site. Cottages from the mill village
		    can still be see where South Ellerbe crosses under Trinity Avenue.</p>

		  <p>Although many of
		    Trinity Park's early settlers were connected with Trinity College, the
		    majority were merchants, businessmen and professionals. In contrast
		    to Durham's late 19th-century neighborhoods, a smaller proportion of
		    Old North Durham and Trinity Park's residents were directly associated
		    with tobacco and textiles. They were part of the broader local economy
		    produced by their families' successes in Durham's leading industries.
		    These younger generations chose not to live in the older neighborhoods
		    where they grew up close to Durham's industries. </p>
		  <p>Standing along
		    this branch of South Ellerbe are the Durham Athletic Park (South Ellerbe
		    flows under the pitcher's mound), Durham Central Park (bisected by the
		    creek), Pearl Mills, and the South Ellerbe bike trail (which will eventually
		    become part of the &quot;urban Appalachian Trail&quot; &#150; a bike path connecting
		    towns from Maine to Florida).</p>
		  <p>The three branches
		    join forces near Northgate Park and flow east, past the Avondale Road
		    K-Mart, Camden Avenue asphalt plant and the old City dump. Near the
		    dump, Ellerbe Creek was channelized, chocked with industrial effluent
		    and leachate (which one writer has called &quot;garbage juice&quot;). At the turn
		    of the last century, the local wags were already calling it &quot;Allergy
		    Creek&quot; (from Ernest Seaman's novel, &quot;American Gold&quot;).</p>
		  <p>Ellerbe&acute;s
		    last miles are its most serene as it flows along a quiet stretch of
		    bent trees and into Falls Lake at an old wooden railroad bridge (less
		    than a mile south of where the Eno River flows into the lake).</p>

		  Along some wooded
		    stretches, Ellerbe's creeks quietly flow through areas as scenic as
		    any in North Carolina. Elsewhere, the Ellerbe watershed deserves its
		    status among state&acute;s most polluted creeks. Flowing past history
		    and through Durham's neighborhoods, these 'pretty rivulets' absorb the
		    city's ills as their waters journey toward the sea.

                50 years, Durham had spread rapidly from a village to a bustling
                factory center, sucking in the rolling pine country around it.
                Shacks for factory workers mushroomed in the lowlands between
                the graded streets. The little communities, which clung precariously
                to the banks of streams or sat crazily on washed out gullies and
                were held together by cowpaths or rutted wagon tracks, were called
                the Bottoms. It was as if the town had swallowed more than it
                could hold and had regurgitated, for the Bottoms was an odorous
                conglomeration of trash piles, garbage dumps, cow stalls, pigpens
                and crowded humanity ....&quot; </p>

                <p>&quot;The
                  city is built on a low ridge which serves as a watershed between
                  the Eno and the Neuse on the north, and New Hope creek, which
                  is a tributary of the Cape Fear, on the south. As might be expected
                  the soil is poor and unsuited to the cultivation of most crops
                  that a pioneer would be likely to raise. So a student is likely
                  to conclude that in the early settlement of the country this section
                  would not be taken up by the first settlers. The more fertile
                  tracts along the New Hope on the south and the Eno and Neuse on
                  the west and north attracted the new home-seekers and the land
                  lying between them was for some time left vacant. Later on, when
                  the settlements became more thickly populated, the shiftless were
                  pushed out of the fertile acres and came into this poor section
                  of country and built themselves homes. As all know, the shiftless
                  and poor are liable to give way to the less refined forms of vice
                  and we find the people of this section no exception to the rule.&quot;</p>
