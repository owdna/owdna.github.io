        <font size="2">Magnolia Grill (the original Wellspring Grocery location).
          For years, Floyd Wright operated a grocery on this corner (in the small
          frame building that now stands behind the Magnolia Grill -- facing West
          Knox Street). According to Tom Walker, long-time County Commissioner
          Dewey Scarboro built the existing brick building in 1947. Across the
          street from EK Powe School, Scarboro Grocery was a favorite stop for
          children for some 40 years. Mr. Scarboro closed his store in 1978 and
          an Old West Durham institution, Wellspring Grocery, sold its first produce
          through these doors. Today, this old neighborhood grocery store is home
          to one of the South's most acclaimed restaurants -- Magnolia Grill. </font></font></p>

      <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This neighborhood
        store was located in the 2600 Block of Hillsborough Rd. and was operated
        by Mr. A.W. &quot;Bill&quot; Holmes from 1946 to 1949. The business
        was then moved across the street and continued to operate under the
        same name until 1986.</font> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bill,
          always with a smile, would welcome his many customers. </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After
            school and on weekends, The Ideal Sundry was also a favorite meeting
            place for teenagers. Here with our friends, we could enjoy a cold soda,
            select a favorite &quot;comic book&quot; or buy anything from toys to chips.<br />

      During World War II, Fent's Place moved to a spot on Hillsboro Road,
      between Doc Newton's Ideal Sundry and Rufus Ferrel's barber shop. Long-time
      resident Moe Utley recalls working at Forrest Grocery and Wallace Lumber
      Yard on Rosehill for 10 cents an hour. He also worked at Ideal Sundry
      for 15 cents an hour, delivering goods to neighborhood homes. Today,
      Moe is the only Kitty Hawk resident with an &quot;Old West Durham&quot; bumper

    Old Garrard's Grocery Store, 2606 Hillsborough Road (across from Greystone
    Baptist)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Built in the very early 1900s, this building has mostly
    served as a neighborhood grocery -- starting as Garrard's Grocery Store.
    Long-time resident Bill Holmes recalls Garrett's mule-drawn wagon that
    delivered groceries to the nearby homes in the West Durham mill village. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Haygood Grocery Store then occupied the building for
    many years. At one point the owners realized that a local ordinance
    stipulated they were too close to Greystone Baptist to sell liquor.
    The solution was to build a partition right down the middle of the store
    and punch out a second door out front. The new door was far enough away
    from the church to allow the sale of liquor.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">A plumbing store was later replaced by a Chinese Grocery
    store for several years until it closed in 1985 (about the same time
    the mills shut down). A shop that printed tee-shirts (and offered shoe
    shines out front) operated for awhile before the building stood vacant
    for a period of time.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Over the years, different users of Garrard's Grocery
    had added stud walls and an eight-foot high ceiling to divide the space
    into numerous small, dark rooms. The original brickwork had been covered
    with stucco, and paneling had been installed over that. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Today, the old Garrard's Grocery is the home of Fisher
    Signs. Owner Mitch Fisher extensively restored the historic building.
    He removed all newer interior walls to expose 10-foot high tongue and
    groove heart of pine ceilings and sandblasted the stucco to expose the
    original brick. The efforts to restore this important neighborhood building
    led to OWDNA bestowing its &quot;Pinhook Award&quot; to Mitch Fisher for his inspirational
    efforts.</font> </p>

  <p>Once upon a time, for most people at least, there were no cars, refrigerators
    were unheard of and ice-boxes were doubtful, tiny affairs. In those
    days the institution of the neighborhood grocery story, just around
    the corner as it was, solved most people's food storage and mobility
    problems. Time, perniciously, moved on, however, and cars, refrigerators,
    deep chest freezers, supermarkets, Sam's and hanger-sized Costco stores
    have rendered the neighborhood grocery obsolete.</p>
  <p>This leaves most older neighborhoods with a problem--what to do with
    the building which once housed the eggs, the canned goods, the produce,
    and the cokes in those little bottles. These buildings are everywhere
    throughout Durham -- often right in amongst the homes they once served.
    Usually, they can't be homes themselves -- although we've honored notable
    exceptions -- and they can't be retail shops again --zoning and neighbors
    prevent that. Sometimes, they sit empty and useless and sometimes new
    owners and new ideas bring new life.</p>
   <p>Garrard's Grocery on Hillsborough Road was built
    in the early part of the century to serve the huge Erwin Mill Village
    that surrounded it. Mill workers passed it on their foot-bound journeys
    to and from work. Garrett's mule-drawn produce wagon ambled up and down
    the dusty streets. After Garrett's came Haygood's grocery. Haygood measured
    the distance from Greystone Baptist and discovered that his store was
    too close for lawful liquor sales. Ingeniously, he partitioned the building
    into two halves and put in a second door out front. This door was just
    beyond the line, and Haywood did a rollicking business.</p>
  <p>When the grocery business moved on, the building went searching for
    a purpose. Such buildings can be dangerous for neighborhoods. New owners
    are seldom content to operate within the limited confines of an obsolete
    retail idea. They want bigger and better.</p>
  <p>Fortunately for West Durham, Mitch Fisher acquired the Garrard's Grocery
    building, renovated it, and moved his sign shop and framing studio into
    it. The building has been much altered over time, but Mitch saved the
    remaining wood floors and bead board ceiling. </p>
  <p>Mitch's business seems to be the perfect, low-key match for the neighborhood.
    In fact, he's a big supporter of the Old West Durham Neighborhood Association.
    The prominent neighborhood sign at the corner of Markham and Ninth is
    just one of his gifts to his neighbors. We at the society mark his solution
    to the &quot;neighborhood grocery problem&quot; with a Neighborhood Conservation
    award.</p>
