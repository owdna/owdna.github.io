<h2>Duke University in History</h2>

		  <p><font size="2">Before Trinity College's arrival from Randolph County
		    in 1892, East Campus was the site of Blackwell's fairgrounds and race
		    track. Here, grading begins on Duke's first campus in Durham (near West
		    Main and Broad). (photo courtesy of Duke Archives) </font></p>

		  <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Trinity President
		    John Crowell wrote that even though Durham was less than one hundred
		    miles from Randolph County, it was ten thousand miles away psychologically.
		    A railroad box car transported the old college bell, clock, safe and
		    several thousand books. With the move to Durham, the faculty grew from
		    eight in 1890 to seventeen in 1892 and enrollment jumped from 113 to
		    180. The contrast between the old campus and the new one was dramatic.
		    In Old Trinity students lived in community boarding houses and the college
		    consisted of a single all purpose building. In Durham, the spacious
		    county fairground where trotting horses raced and steeple chases were
		    held was converted to a park-like campus of three main buildings, seven
		    faculty residences (with indoor plumbing), and athletic fields complete
		    with a grandstand left over from the race track. Note the rail road
		    tracks which ran straight through campus. (Photo and text courtesy of

		    1909: The Anne Roney Fountain and Stagg Pavilion were built in front
		    of Old East Building in 1902. Anne Roney, Washington Duke's sister-in-law,
		    raised Duke's children after his second wife died. The largest of the
		    American Tobacco Company's twelve warehouses, Smith Warehouse was built
		    across the railroad tracks in 1906 (and now houses Duke offices). Today,
		    the main entrance road into East Campus is farther to the right (closer
		    to Ninth Street). The old fountain still stands (hidden by magnolia
		    trees).</font></p>

              <font size="2">The long narrow bridge-walkway into the Ark forced people
                to enter two-by-two; hence, the reference to Noah's Ark. The walkway
                had been a gateway to the original fairgrounds. North Carolina's first
                college gym and the location of Duke's first basketball games, the Ark
                is built of lumber salvaged from the grandstand when Blackwell's old
                race track was demolished.</font><br />

              <font size="2">Auditorium, Women's College Quadrangle (now Baldwin Auditorium,
                East Campus). In 1896, Washington Duke provided $100,000 for Trinity
                College's endowment with the proviso that the college &quot;will open its
                doors to women placing them on an equal footing with men.&quot; Women had
                been admitted to classes regularly since 1892. However, because there
                was no dormitory for them, female students were not admitted to residences
                on the campus. By requiring the college to open &quot;its doors,&quot; Washington
                Duke meant to admit them to residence. He then provided the funds to
                build a women's dorm (which became in 1897 Duke's first coed dormitory).
                In 1930, the rebuilt Trinity College campus -- now East Campus -- became
                home to the Woman's College of Duke University. Trinity College for
                Men and the graduate and professional schools opened on the newly completed
                West Campus. The Woman's College was progressive in many respects because
                it set in place parallel student organizations in which women could
                take on leadership roles that were normally filled by men. The school
                merged with the once all-male Trinity College in 1972. (source: Duke

              <font size="2">Duke's West Campus was once part of the Rigsbee farm.
                More than 25 years before construction began on the new campus, a northern
                stretch of the farm was sold to make room for the Erwin Mills and some
                of the surrounding mill village near Ninth Street.</font></p>
