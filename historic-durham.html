        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1852, Dr. Bartlett
          Snipes Durham sold four acres to the NC Railroad Co. for a train depot
          east of Pinhook (on the line connecting Goldsboro and Charlotte). While
          the train station has been torn down, Durham still radiates from the
          railroad tracks which were its reason for being and its lifeblood for
          100 years.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>

          Hotel and the Regal Theater on Hayti's Pettigrew Street in the 1940's.
          Hayti was a bustling black business district south of the tracks from
          downtown Durham. Hayti's demise came at the expense of "progress" --
          the Durham Expressway. There were one hundred businesses, including
          movies, drugstores, a hotel (the Biltmore), restaurants, barber and
          beauty shops, cleaners, funeral homes, service stations, banks, insurance
          companies, etc. Unlike other cities in America, Durham was different
          in that blacks lived in other areas all over Durham. Areas such as Walltown,
          parts of Bragtown, Pearsontown, North Durham, Hayestown, East Durham,
          Factory Hill, the West End, the Bottom, College Hill, Brooks Town, Hickstown
          or Crest Street Community and so on. All these areas had their own blacked-owned
          businesses also. (source: Marshall Thompson) </font></p>

        <p><font color="Navy">"In 50 years, Durham had spread rapidly from a village
          to a bustling factory center, sucking in the rolling pine country around
          it. Shacks for factory workers mushroomed in the lowlands between the
          graded streets. The little communities, which clung precariously to
          the banks of streams or sat crazily on washed out gullies and were held
          together by cowpaths or rutted wagon tracks, were called the Bottoms.
          It was as if the town had swallowed more than it could hold and had
          regurgitated, for the Bottoms was an odorous conglomeration of trash
          piles, garbage dumps, cow stalls, pigpens and crowded humanity ...."

          Saloon on downtown railroad tracks. Before the arrival of Erwin Mills
          in West Durham, Pinhook was home to several saloons, grog shops and
          other places of ill-repute. The city voted out saloons in 1902. </font></p>

          on the second floor -- above the sights, smells and sounds of a very
          active city market. Later, City Hall moved into the old high school
          (now Durham Arts Council). The old town auditorium moved from here into
          the Carolina Theatre and the meat market moved to the corner of Foster
          and Morgan streets. This site is now &quot;Bare Square&quot; (between
          the CCB tower and the Blue Coffee Company). Today, the City Council
          meets above the sights, smells and sounds of the City-County Planning
          Department.</font><br>

          homes (Atlas Rigsbee and William Mangum). In the previous decade, the
          Washington Duke Hotel, tall brown building in middle-right, was built
          where the old Academy of Music once stood. Just to the left of the hotel
          stands the familiar CCB tower (white, modernistic 17-story skyscraper
