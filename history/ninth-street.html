          <a href="http://www.ninthst.com">Ninth Street</a>. It includes the Bank 
          of West Durham and, just to the left, McDonald's Drug store, built in 
          1918 and still standing with an altered facade. (Courtesy of the Historic

          1938. Old brick, two-story Post Office rises next to the mill pond. 
          The smaller building on the side was a shoe shop (Pud's Repair) run 
          by Pud Pendergrass. Corner gas station across the street is where the 
          BP station is today. Bagels are now sold in the West Durham Bank (upper-right).</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before the gas 
          station, this corner was home to the West Durham Methodist church. The 
          original chapel was built in 1896 (left) and the larger church was added 
          as membership grew.</font></p>

          The shades and curtains were always pulled. During worker strikes, the 
          union gave out bags of flour, sugar and lard. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2">This was taken on Ninth Street in 1964. The mill village 
          stretched right up to the edge of Erwin Mills. This old mill house was 
          taken down to make room for the parking lot on Ninth Street. According 
          to one long-time merchant, William Erwin would take kids who misbehaved 
          to the top of this mill tower (later shortened) and have a little heart-to-heart.

          Did you know that, for many years, the sidewalk in front of the Ninth 
          Street shops was covered with a metal awning? In February 1987, a vicious 
          ice storm toppled most of the awnings. The last segment of the old metal 
          awning was removed when Charlie's Bar &amp; Grill arrived on Ninth Street 
          in 2001.</font></p>

              <p><b>Ninth Street Myth </b><br>
                from West Durham Winter, by George Zabriskie (Knopf, 1941)</p>
              <p>The gaunt houses line the street in a desolate mill row. <br>
                Grey and yellow identical boxes under impersonal trees</p>
              <p>Grown skeletal from autumn, and behind them the mill,<br>
                A great horizontal-blocking wall, red bricked and solidly <br>
                Blue windowed, its phallic stacks erect in mouse grey sky, <br>
                A blanket of cancerous sound, the loom noise dumbly covers <br>
                The neighborhood, extinguishing the voices in the streets. <br>
                Starkly, sterile December dulls the bony landscape<br>
                In sensitive tinted twilight. Not the hard frozen <br>
                Earth of the north, where soil rings with bootsteps,<br>
                But a slow dry land, chilled to grass roots only,<br>
                Its side roads still dusty, and night still bearable, <br>
                Leaving the ears unstung, the cheeks still flexible, <br>
                Blue mill windows, house windows lighted slowly, <br>
                Watch blankly and utterly the street and people, holding <br>
                The hanging faces mirrored in our dreams. The stores<br>
                Are cheapjack tinsel paradise; walk here, gaping <br>
                With the rest at light and warmth inside the bright <br>
                Paragon, the Pender Store, Daily's, priced for the trade <br>
                Of faces pressed to glass, those mill touched eyes <br>
                Narrowed by prospects of familiar walls and streets. </p>
              <p>Eyeing the ten cent toys, but buying fat back, loafing<br>
                In the pool room, the lunch stand where the truckers<br>
                Stop to eat, the people are in sluggish circulation and <br>
                By the corner drug store, the "U.S. Seventy" sign under <br>
                The arc light is symbol of their linkage to the land.</p>
              <p>Frost cracks this world apart, streets limit it: <br>
                And was it by desire ever infinite, the time <br>
                Has passed; leaves, papers in the gutters, mills<br>
                Delineate this life. In small and soiled houses<br>
                Existence grows to huge unspoken weariness </p>
              <p>Like a simple empty alley, this Ninth Street has an end, <br>
                And yet from there it is unending, stretching to some <br>
                Unlimited autumn fading into winter, a dead suspended <br>
                Land where people surely move like joyless ghosts <br>
                Tending the pretty machinery that governs life; invisible <br>
                And untiring beyond the weariness of flesh and mind, <br>
                Learning in strange hypnotic dreams to hold themselves<br>
                From joy or tragedy, like insects dulled by winter. <br>
                The trees jutting like raw fingers, and even the grass</p>
              <p>Grey as molded straw, a silent fungus world where peace <br>
                Is real, not relative, a vast suspended act of death.</p>
