        <p>July 16, 1990 marked the end of an era in the history of the construction 
          of Duke University. On that date Louis Fara, a native of Frugarola, 
          Italy, and the last of the original stone setters who skillfully laid 
          the Indiana limestone trim on West Campus, died. Fara was representative 
          of a group of laborers whose unique background and contribution will 
          be acknowledged as long as eyes gaze upon Duke's majestic Gothic arches.

        <p>Documentation of these laborers' contributions is almost nonexistent. 
          Photographs are extremely scarce, since construction took place during 
          the Great Depression and laboring families did not frivolously spend 
          hard-earned money on family snapshots. A few photographs have turned 
          up, usually passport photos of younger men or pictures of much older 
          men working on later commissions. Official university construction photos 
          concentrate on architectural detail instead of the human element. The 
          laborers' background and their sense of accomplishment have to be pieced 
          together from scattered published interviews. Fortunately, their names 
          are familiar, for many remained in Durham to raise their families. Six 
          decades after the completion of West Campus the city telephone directory 
          still lists the Italian names of Fara, Ribet, Ferettino, Citrini, and 
          Berini. In addition, Giobbi and Greppi worked the stone as well as the 
          highly respected stone workers Macadie and Brown. They worked along 
          side native blacks and mountain whites who had also migrated to Durham 
          in search of steady employment during severe economic times. </p>

        <p>Each laborer became an accomplished artisan at his assigned level of 
          work. Stonemasons worked the "rubble" bluestone from the nearby Hillsborough 
          quarry. Often thought akin to brick layers, stonemasons did not believe 
          the skills were interchangeable. Expert stonemasons had to have a feeling 
          for color and design as well as the skill to size and shape each stone. 
          These intangible and tangible qualities were vital to the West Campus 
          project where the beauty of the stone was in its fourteen plus shades 
          of color and where each piece was cut at a ratio of length two times 
          height. </p>

        <p>Only the very best men were selected for the more delicate work with 
          "cutstone" or Indiana limestone. They were almost all Italians working 
          for the subcontractor James W. Brown under the supervision of Donald 
          Macadie. Brown and Macadie were natives of Scotland who immigrated to 
          the United States early in the century and located in the south as a 
          result of assigned commissions. The Italians, too, were most often immigrants 
          who came to Duke as word circulated among friends and relatives that 
          there was stone work in Durham, North Carolina. Many had been apprenticed 
          in the Alps of Italy, Switzerland, or France, as had been Tony Berini, 
          for a season's pay of "food, lodging, and a suit of clothes, pair of 
          shoes and a bright red cap." In the United States, they were working 
          in New York City or the coal mines of West Virginia before answering 
          the call to Duke. The stone setters set the arches and doorways throughout 
          the campus, capping their employment with the soaring nave of the Chapel. 
          When the campus opened in September, 1930, a select crew remained to 
          finish the Chapel. They were doubly proud because of the special recognition 
          of their expertise and because they were completing such a magnificent 
          structure. It was as if every stone setter, particularly those with 
          European backgrounds, wanted to work on a Gothic cathedral in their 
          lifetime. As the Duke commission finished many worked on nearby government 
          building projects financed by the New Deal, and some traveled west to 
          build tunnels on the Blue Ridge Parkway. </p>
