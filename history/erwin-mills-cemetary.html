        <p><font size="2"> What started as one man's quest for his grandfather's
          grave site brought scores of volunteers Saturday to the long-neglected
          resting place of the people who built West Durham. </font>
        <p><font size="2"> About 65 people worked all morning with chain saws,
          axes and their hands, clearing away truckloads of brambles and saplings
          from the old Erwin Mills cemetery. The effort was organized by the Old
          West Durham Neighborhood Association. Bill Yarbrough of Chesapeake,
          Va., sought the headstone of his grandfather, Edward, who spelled the
          name Yarborough and reportedly was buried in 1936 in the cemetery for
          employees of the old cotton mill. He didn't find it. </font>

        <p><font size="2">But other descendants of mill workers found and cleaned
          up their forebears' graves, like that of Irene, wife of W.H. Cole, whose
          headstone stood surrounded by a small iron fence near the gravel road
          that passes the site, off LaSalle Street, just south of the railroad
          line through town. </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2"> They also found daffodils blooming untended as they
          had for generations. Their seasonal reappearance after the cemetery
          had been all but abandoned for decades impressed John Schelp as symbolic,
          and he suggested that the neighborhood plant more there. </font>

        <p><font size="2">"We knew there was a cemetery here," said Schelp, president
          of the neighborhood association, by way of explaining how the idea for
          the cleanup took root and grew. "But not many people knew much about
          it." </font>
        <p><font size="2"> Schelp found something else that he recognized from
          having seen something similar half a world away. </font>
        <p><font size="2"> He scanned the ground, thickly carpeted with fallen
          leaves, until he found a small patch of white. He bent down and brushed
          away the leaves to reveal a dozen or so weathered but well-preserved
          white seashells, large whelks, lying together on the ground. </font>
        <p><font size="2"> Just like in cemeteries in the African Congo, he said,
          where he had lived more than 20 years earlier as a Peace Corps worker.
          </font>
        <p> <font size="2">"Every time you'd come and visit, you'd leave a shell,"
          he said. </font>
        <p><font size="2"> Last fall, when he first spotted the shells, he started
          researching his hunch - that there, in West Durham, an ancient African
          burial custom had persisted in the 20th century. Sure enough, he found
          death certificates for blacks buried in the Erwin Mills cemetery. Perhaps
          even more unusual, they lay buried beside whites at a time when even
          graveyards usually were strictly segregated by race. </font>

        <p><font size="2">Yarbrough's quest started last fall, when he was looking
          through some old papers belonging to his late mother. Among them were
          yellowed newspaper fragments containing Edward Yarborough's obituary.
          Yarbrough found clues in them: Durham and the Erwin cotton mill cemetery.
          </font>
        <p><font size="2"> He did a little Web surfing, found Old West Durham's
          site (<a href="index.html">http://oldwestdurham.org</a>)
          and dispatched an e-mail to Schelp. </font>
        <p><font size="2"> Schelp replied and started inquiring among older residents,
          like John McDonald of McDonald's Drug Store on Ninth Street. </font>
        <p><font size="2"> Eventually, he discovered that the cemetery was begun
          the same year as the mill and Trinity College, now Duke East Campus,
          1893, dated by the earliest headstone date. The most recent ones are
          from the 1990s. Most of the headstones are modest marble and granite
          markers. Some are homemade, of fieldstone or the two upended concrete
          downspout splash blocks that bear indecipherable traces of paint. </font>

        <p><font size="2"> Schelp learned that William Erwin, the mill's owner,
          offered free burial in the cemetery to his workers. </font>
        <p><font size="2"> In November, Yarbrough visited Durham, and he and Schelp
          toured the overgrown cemetery and began planning the cleanup. About
          40 percent of those who participated Saturday were Old West Durham residents,
          about 40 percent were descendants of people buried there, and about
          20 percent had no connection other than their goodwill, he said. </font>
        <p> <font size="2">"I think we are inspired to have another cleanup,"
          Schelp said. </font>
        <p> <font size="2">"I feel great now," Yarbrough said. "You can see the
          headstones." </font>
        <p><font size="2"> Even though his grandfather's wasn't among them, he
          was satisfied. </font>
        <p> <font size="2">"It makes me feel good that people still care," he
          said. </font>

        <p><font size="2"> Bill Yarbrough's search for the burial place of an
          ancestor helped prompt a neighborly act in Durham. Yarbrough, of Chesapeake,
          Va., had wanted to find the headstone for his grandfather, Edward H.
          Yarbrough, whom he believed to be buried in the old Erwin Mills Cemetery.
          Yarbrough contacted the Web site of the Old West Durham neighborhood
          Association. The association's president, John Schelp, picked up on
          the e-mail and began a search of his own. </font>
        <p><font size="2"> Yarbrough visited in November, and he, Schelp and other
          members of the neighborhood association began planning a clean-up of
          the Erwin Mills Cemetery. Last Saturday, about 65 people -- many of
          them descendants of people buried in the cemetery, -- cleared brush
          and brambles from the historic cemetery. </font>
        <p><font size="2"> There's a happy ending to Yarbrough's search. In a
          letter to the editor published Friday, he said that a Durham woman,
          after reading news coverage of the clean-up, called Schelp and advised
          him of a survey she had worked on in the 1980s documenting the sites
          in the cemetery. She found record of Crittie Florence Yarbrough, wife
          of Edward H. Yarbrough, buried in the cemetery in an unmarked grave.
          </font>
        <p><font size="2"> Bill Yarbrough's confirmation all came because Schelp
          chose not to ignore his e-mail. We bestow upon Schelp, the Old West
          Durham Neighborhood Association and all who cleaned up Erwin Mills Cemetery
          our Durham Grit Award. </font>
