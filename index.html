<h3>Pin Hook</h3>

<p class="owdna-p">Located near Duke's East Campus and Ninth Street, Old West Durham is one of the
oldest neighborhoods in the Bull City. Previously known as Pin Hook, the area was
settled before Durham itself.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Pin Hook began as a tiny settlement that served as a traveler's rest before the
railroad town of Durham was established in the early 1850s. Pin Hookers were folks who
bought tobacco leaf that went unsold at auction, repackaged the product, and sold it
for a tiny profit. Jean Anderson provides wonderful accounts of Pin Hook in her
outstanding book on Durham history... In the early days, the shiftless of society,
usually addicted to vices of one sort or another, tended to congregate in Pin Hook,
attracting others of their kind.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">The settlement included a lodging house, camping grove, brothels, grog shops, and a
well for drinking water for passing travelers. In spite of the dirt and noise caused by
the railroad that ran through Pin Hook, people gradually settled near the Hillsborough
Road with its easy access to Durham.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">A story in the Hillsborough newspaper in 1871 described the early character of the
neighborhood. "There is a place called Pin Hook... and it is remarkable for a race that
was run there many years ago by a man and a woman. They wore no clothes and ran for a
quart of liquor."</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Because of Pin Hook's harsh reputation, Meredith College decided not to locate in
the area. And, Trinity College almost decided to go elsewhere. It was not until the
early 1890s, and the building of the Erwin Cotton Mills that Pin Hook would transform
itself into the mill village of West Durham.</p>

<h3>Erwin Cotton Mills</h3>

<img src="/images/history/rigsbee.jpg" class="pull-right history-image" style="border: solid 1px #ccc; margin: 0 0 5px 20px;" />

<p class="owdna-p">Throughout the 19th century, much of the area around Pin Hook was farmland.
According to the Herald-Sun, the Rigsbee family farm stretched 600 acres -- including
the Ninth Street area. For one hundred years, the Rigsbees raised tobacco, corn, and
sweet potatoes on the hills south of Old West Durham. They kept their pigs down in a
ravine. In 1892, the Rigsbees sold a northern section of their land for the
construction of Erwin Mills. 33 years later, they sold their holdings for a new
university. That land is now called Duke's West Campus. And the ravine where the pigs
were kept is now called Wallace Wade Stadium (site of the 1942 Rose Bowl -- moved to
Durham due to fears of having large crowds on the west coast after Pearl Harbor).
Today, you can still see the small Rigsbee family cemetery -- surrounded by a low, Duke
stone wall and the football stadium parking lot.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">As you walk down Ninth Street today, the long red brick building across from the
Regulator Bookshop seems to be an almost forgotten footnote of history. And yet the
<a href="#">Erwin Cotton Mills</a> were the driving force that made Old West Durham what it is today.
Durham County by Jean Anderson and The Durham Architectural And Historic Inventory
(Historic Preservation Society of Durham) offer outstanding accounts of the impact
Erwin Mills would have on the neighborhood. According to Anderson, the new company
bought several adjacent tracts of land in West Durham and built a brick factory 75 by
347 feet, two stories high, with a picker building, dyehouse, boiler room, and engine
house. Rows of neat houses were built for the workers, who in 1895 numbered 375. The
factory then had 11,000 spindles and 360 looms producing fine muslin, chambrays,
camlets, and denims.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Paul Bonner writes in the Herald-Sun that the steady noise of the mills reverberated
throughout the surrounding village -- and so pervaded the workers' consciousness that
they noticed it only when it ceased, making Sundays seem unnaturally still. Company
housing was modest and decent by the standards of the times, decidedly Spartan by those
of today. The houses had running water but most lacked bathtubs and some lacked
commodes. They were heated by coal stoves and most had electricity. Families hung a
card on their front porches to indicate to the ice deliveryman how many pounds to put
in their icebox that day. Some houses had "Do-not-Disturb" signs advising that a
third-shift worker slept there during the day (<a href="">full text</a>).</p>

<h3>Mill Village</h3>

<p class="owdna-p">One long-time resident recalls that many of the neighborhood's oldest homes were
built of wood from a small forest that stood in Old West Durham. A sawmill was set up
in the middle of the woods that is now Erwin Square.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">As the trees were cleared to build Erwin Mills, they were sawed into planks that
were used to build the earliest mill homes that line many of our streets.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">According to the Durham Inventory, Old West Durham boasts several mill homes with
one of three basic designs: the simple pyramid roof, L-shaped or T-shaped (your
standing at the mill determined the house in which you lived). Others, like pastors and
merchants, built frame homes ordered from catalogues like Sears &amp; Roebuck and others.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Anderson added that the mill homes were, "clean, well-maintained, inexpensive
(usually about twenty-five cents per room per week), and convenient. They liked the
sociability of the village. They had space in their yards for vegetables and flowers...
Christmas was a wonderful time. Everyone got an apple and an orange and a stick of
candy."</p>

<p class="owdna-p">The Durham Architectural And Historic Inventory points out that "a great number of
these houses survive today in neat rows of identical forms situated close to the
street, presenting a clear idea of the early character of the West Durham mill village."</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Most homes sit at the front of deep narrow lots -- perfect for vegetable gardens out
back. Small grocery stores dotted the residential streets as well -- including what is
now Magnolia Grill and West Durham Tire. Long-time residents recall the smell of soapy
laundry that would often cover much of the neighborhood -- from the mills' dye ponds
along Hillsborough Road.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">For years, Floyd Wright operated a grocery in the small frame building that now
stands behind the Magnolia Grill -- facing West Knox Street. According to Tom Walker,
long-time County Commissioner Dewey Scarboro built the existing brick building in 1947.
Across the street from E.K. Powe School, Scarboro Grocery was a favorite stop for
children for some 40 years. Mr. Scarboro closed his store in 1978 and an Old West
Durham institution, Wellspring Grocery, sold its first produce through these doors.
Today, this old neighborhood grocery store is home to one of the South's most acclaimed
restaurants -- Magnolia Grill.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Old-time tent revivals were often held at Rosehill Avenue and Knox (just up the hill
from Skunk Hollow and the old Wallace grocery store) where messages of inspiration were
broadcast through loud speakers for all to hear. Later, one neighborhood church was
torn down and replaced by an ABC liquor store.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Across the railroad tracks (near where West Main and Trent intersect today) stood a
school called Southside. Situated on a hill, the school was fronted by terraced lawns
and several mature trees (today, the site of the old campus is the northern embankment
of the Durham Freeway). The land along this stretch of the freeway was once home to a
large number of mill houses for Erwin Mills (several are still standing south of the
freeway including along Case, Hull, Powe and Faber streets). Many of the children
living in this area attended Southside School (ca. 1921).</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Nearby was a community of blacks and whites called Hickstown. In 1978, City and
State leaders sought to push the Durham Freeway through mostly African American
neighborhoods. In response, a coalition of community residents and progressive whites
worked to save Hickstown (now called Crest Street neighborhood) by rebuilding it near
the VA medical center. This effort resulted in a $10 million settlement for the Crest
Street community that, for the first time in U.S. history, used highway relocation
funds to benefit an entire neighborhood instead of individual homeowners. Hickstown was
named after landowner Hawkins Hicks -- whose tombstone can still be found on the
eastern edge of the Erwin Mills cemetery. Today, Hicks Street (near the St. Francis
Animal Hospital) stands as a quiet reminder of the old community.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Farther east was the black settlement of Brookstown (today mostly under the freeway
and along either side of Swift Street). The area was once dotted with dozens of
one-story frame houses including Moses Hester's house on West Pettigrew, near Swift,
which served as both a carpenter's shop and a church. Residents of Brookstown worked in
both the tobacco factory and Erwin Mill. Others worked at the Marvin Teer Brickyard
located near Swift and Faber streets. The brickyard was later sold to Samuel Fitzgerald
and operated under the name of Fitzgerald Brickyard (the old African-American
Fitzgerald cemetery, next to Maplewood Cemetery, was named after this family).
According to historian Alice Eley Jones, Erwin Mills (like many of Durham's factories)
were built using the famous Fitzgerald bricks. The old brickyard site is now Duke's
Freeman Center for Jewish Life (and if you look in the underbrush you can still see a
brick or two).</p>

<p class="owdna-p">The Durham Inventory describes textile mills as a "combination of paternalism and
economic sanctions that included long hours, low wages, and poor living conditions...
and the Erwin mill and the village that grew around it reflected many of the harsh
realities of the period and the industry." And yet, William Erwin (Benjamin Duke's
business partner for the mill) "earned widespread notice for reducing the work days at
his factories to eleven hours and for refusing to employ underage children. He also
provided the West Durham community with a park before Durham had any city parks. In
1895 he equipped the large grove across the railroad tracks opposite the mill with
swings and benches. This park almost instantly became the social and recreation center
of the community's life, exemplified by the brass band organized here the same year
among the mill workers."</p>

  <div style="max-width: 400px; margin: 2px auto;">
    West Durham Library: The first Erwin Mills library stood near the corner of
    Hillsboro Road and Ninth Street. One local theory says that when the library was moved
    to Erwin Auditorium, the original two-story library became the home of Mr. McCauley
    Fields. Long-time residents say the Fields house looked like the old library. It stood
    just west of what is now Vin Rouge. In the past, Edith Street ended a block farther
    south -- at Hillsboro Rd. (Photo ca. 1918)
  </div>
</div>


<p class="owdna-p">However, working conditions during the Great Depression brought relations between
mill workers and management to a boiling point. In September 1934, tens of thousands of
textile workers throughout the South walked off the job protesting conditions at the
mills and in company-controlled mill villages. According to the News & Observer,
hundreds of striking Erwin Mills workers rallied at the Carolina Theatre, marched down
Main Street and enjoyed widespread community support. The General Textile Strike of
1934 ended three weeks later with some 20 workers dead from strike-related violence,
others sitting in internment camps and little progress for the "lintheads," the
pejorative term for cotton mill workers in the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and
Alabama. Years later, the memory of the strike (considered by historians the largest
labor revolt in Southern history) has faded along with the mill villages it helped
eliminate. In a part of the country where "union" often has the status of a four-letter
word, the strike showed that Southern workers can organize for change even during the
Great Depression and amid the constraints of having the mill as employer, landlord and
store owner.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Bill Holmes (owner of The Ideal Sundry on Hillsborough Road) tells us that mill
workers and their families were even provided with free cemetery plots at the western
edge of the mill village. The Erwin Mills cemetery (aka Cedar Hill) is located in what
was then Hickstown. In 1957, Erwin Mills sold the cemetery to the Knights of Pythias
for $1.00. The cemetery is still standing on a quiet stretch of West Pettigrew Street
(in a grove of forgotten trees behind West Durham Lumber -- between the railroad tracks
and the Durham Freeway). The Old West Durham Neighborhood Association organized three
cemetery clean-ups to remove several truckloads of underbrush, paint the fence, install
two cemetery signs and plant more that 200 daffodil bulbs.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">According to E.K. Powe III, "because there was no air-conditioning, everyone sat on
the porch after supper until it was cool enough to retire. Another front porch pastime
was watching the train go by. There used to be a little wooden station just before the
Ninth Street over-pass where passengers could board the train. You would hear the shirk
of the whistle when the train was about to arrive."</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Powe added that West Durham was also home to "one of the first automobiles in
Durham, a Hudson with wide running boards and two spare tires at the front. [one long
time resident] remembers her brother hopping out to light the headlights at twilight."</p>

<p class="owdna-p">"Powe also described how when his grandfather, E.K. Powe (the mill's first general
manager), walked through the mill village...", he would stop to talk to the workers in
their yards and on their front porches. He invited them to band concerts in the park.
He took them rose bushes to plant in their yards, many of which are still blooming in
West Durham today. "When E.K. Powe died in 1929, the school on Ninth Street was named
in his honor -- reflecting Powe's concern for the educational needs of the neighborhood
children."</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Erwin also strictly supervised the mill village, according to Powe. "If he heard
that one of the daughters of an employee was acting too amorously with young West
Durham men, he would admonish her parents to correct the situation, or be fired!"</p>

<p class="owdna-p">This approach quickly put and end to the infamous history of Pin Hook's past. By the
time Durham had reached a population of 5,000, Erwin was able to boast, "Moral
conditions of my town, West Durham, are better than any in the city."</p>

<h3>Duke University</h3>

<p class="owdna-p">About the same time the Erwin Mills were getting started, the eastern edge of Old
West Durham was home to a fairground, horse racetrack, stables, and grandstand all
known as Blackwell's Park. (According to Powe, a horse raised at Blackwell's named
Baxter took third place in the Kentucky Derby).</p>

<p class="owdna-p">In the 1880s, the trustees of Trinity College were looking for a new campus and had
narrowed its choices to Raleigh or Durham. In 1889, they accepted Durham's offer of 62
acres (at West Main and Broad streets) donated by Julian Carr and $85,000 from
Washington Duke. Blackwell's Park had become Trinity College and would eventually
become Duke University.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">The design of Duke's East Campus largely follows the layout of the original race
track. Some of the first football games in the South took place on Duke's East Campus
between Trinity College and the University of North Carolina (beginning one of the
greatest rivalries in all sports). Later, one of the state's first college basketball
game was played in the old Ark on East Campus when Duke beat UNC, 19-18, on January 24,
1920.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">The break in the campus wall along Broad Street (by the turf field and row of
cypresses) is possibly the old entrance to Blackwell Park and the race-track. Long-time
residents remember a brick (not Duke stone) element of the wall along this stretch.</p>

<h3>Ninth Street Merchant's District</h3>

</div>

<p class="owdna-p">According to the Durham Herald-Sun, Ninth Street saw its first real boom about 1910.
Brick facades replaced old, wood-frame buildings on the eastern side of the street. Two
groceries, two drugstores, a general store, a boot maker and watchmaker, filling
stations, banks and others served more than 1,600 mill workers by the 1920s.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Farther up Ninth Street (previously called Main Street) stands E.K. Powe Elementary
School (formally West Durham Graded School No. 2) and the city's oldest fire station.
According to retired fire fighter, Wayne Smith, Fire Station #2 was originally located
at the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Factory on West Main. The City moved the station further
out to get faster response times to fires in the residential areas and nearby schools
and hospitals (Duke and Watts). The Ninth Street property was purchased by the City
from the heirs of Mrs. Ida Couch for about $7,000. The colonial-designed fire station
was built for $165,000 and was described as "one of the most modern fire stations in
the South." The station was formally dedicated on September 28, 1950 by Fire Chief
Cosmo Cox.</p>

    College and Watts Hospital, Company 2 was eventually moved to its present location at
    Ninth and Knox.

<p class="owdna-p">In 1922, McDonald's Drugstore moved to Ninth Street from downtown. By the 1930s,
unpaved Ninth Street -- with its pool halls and underpaid factory workers -- could be a
rough place. Fights broke out among laid-off men. People were frustrated and had too
much extra time according to the Herald-Sun. During the Depression, the Bank of West
Durham, next to McDonald's Drugstore, would close its doors for the last time.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">After the post-war boom, the 1960s and 1970s brought further changes according to
long-time residents. One week after the Couch furniture store was built on Ninth Street
in 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated and the new store was burned down. The
National Guard was called to Ninth Street. (A brick Couch office building now stands on
the site of the old furniture store.)</p>

<p class="owdna-p">During the 1970s, Northgate Mall opened -- drawing away shoppers. Then Erwin Cotton
Mills merged with Burlington Industries and gradually began closing its factory in West
Durham. Times had hit rock-bottom.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">In 1976, two friends opened an eclectic bookstore on Ninth Street and people thought
they were crazy. More than twenty years later, the Regulator Bookshop is the first
destination for many Ninth Street patrons. Other early businesses followed including
Wellspring Grocery, Ninth Street Bakery, Vaguely Reminiscent, and Francesca's Ice Cream.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">The Independent (the Triangle's favorite alternative weekly) started operating out
of a small brick and cinder block building at 2824 Hillsborough Road in 1982. The Old
West Durham site was chosen because one co-founder had his typesetting business there
and the other lived nearby. The early staff of 15 was crammed into an almost windowless
building that was shared with the car radio repair folks who are still there today. In
1986, the Independent moved a block up the street to its current location. Indy staff
converted the old duplex into an office by poking holes in a couple of walls and
building an addition -- over four weekends of sweat. Today, while there are few
residences left on Hillsborough, the Indy's next door neighbors have remained -- along
with their wonderful garden out back.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">In 1986, much of Old West Durham was designated by the U.S. National Park Service as
a National Registry Historic District. Places listed on the Register include historic
districts that are significant in American history, architecture, archeology, and
culture. In addition, several historic properties in Old West Durham have been
recognized by the Historic Preservation Society of Durham for excellence in preserving
our built heritage. The E.K. Powe house (1503 West Pettigrew) and the Erwin Mills
(Ninth Street) are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. National
Register properties are distinguished historic properties worthy of preservation that
have been documented to recognize the accomplishments of all peoples who have
contributed to the history and heritage of the United States.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Old West Durham recently received local, statewide and national recognition for its
efforts to tell the story of its neighborhood history on the Web. OWDNA was honored by
the Historic Preservation Society of Durham with the Pyne Preservation Award, by
Preservation North Carolina with the Carraway Award and by the U.S. Library of Congress
as a "Local Legacy."</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Today, the booming Ninth Street area has become one of the Triangle's most popular
destinations where visitors, students, and neighbors enjoy a diverse offering of
excellent restaurants and eclectic shops in the heart of an old mill village.</p>

<p class="owdna-p">Historic Old West Durham remains a collection of quiet, tree-lined streets. Our
neighborhood is a place with a colorful past and a bright future. Ours is a place where
the front porch is still used for visiting with neighbors, where the train whistle is still appreciated,
and where the roses still bloom. This is our home.</p>
