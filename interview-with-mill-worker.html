          have no money in the bank. There weren't much money spent. But it didn't

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mrs. Theotis Williamson 
          worked as a spinner at Erwin Mills in West Durham from 1915 (at age 
          12) to 1960. Her family moved from Sampson County to make a better living 
          at the mill. The interview mostly covers family and community topics: 
          day-to-day living, residential arrangements, recreation, childbirth, 
          and the West Durham neighborhood.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, my daddy 
          was a carpenter. And momma...there were twelve of us, and I was the 
          third.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: My goodness!</font></p>

          there was nine of us that lived to be grown, and there was three died

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, yes, we 
          all worked in the mill; we all went to working in the mill. Erwin Mill

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: That&acute;s 
          amazing. How about your brothers and sisters?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, they 
          would go in about fourteen. They went to school, the ones younger than 
          I was.</font></p>

          he kept on being a carpenter up here?</font></p>

          were you then?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I don&acute;t 
          remember how old I was. I was about, oh, maybe eighteen when he died. 
          But you see, there were so many younger than I was.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did your parents 
          have a farm or did they work on a farm?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, we worked 
          on another farm. I don&acute;t know what you call it, somebody else&acute;s 
          farm.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did you have 
          any other relatives up here in Durham when you cam, like any of your

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Your family 
          just came on by themselves?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: We later on 
          had an aunt that moved here.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Whey did your 
          parents decide to more up here?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I really 
          don&acute;t know. I think they thought we could make a better living 
          working in the cotton mill--which we did. We enjoyed it; I did.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did you?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: It was like, 
          a lot of your friends were there?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I&acute;ll 
          tell you. There was a whole lot of difference in now and then.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: How is that?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I don&acute;t 
          [laughter] really think they worked us as hard then as they do now; 
          I don&acute;t know.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter] 
          A lot of people have told me that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I&acute;ll 
          tell you, I think we done as we pleased then, &#145;cause there weren&acute;t 
          no fence around the mill, and if we wanted to go home and get a biscuit 
          or anything we&acute;d go home. And I worked with some wonderful people.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: The people 
          who were in the mill then?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: The head men, 
          yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Who do you 
          remember?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh, Mr. Bob 
          Jones. I worked with him until he died of cancer. I seen him die of 
          the cancer, watched him slowly fade away. Bill Gay and Mr. Bob Jones.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: And they were 
          like the supervisors in your area?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, yes, Mr. 
          Jones was the head boss. And I worked for another one, Mr. Bill Phillips; 
          he was the superintendent. He was a wonderful guy. He would come through 
          with his dogs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter] 
          With his dogs&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I&acute;d forgot 
          all them little things.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: He brought 
          his dogs to work?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes. He was 
          the superintendent. He would come through just checking on us. But they&acute;re 
          all gone: most of all of them have gone on now that was there when I 
          was there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did they live 
          over there near the mill?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: And did they 
          come to the</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Mr. Bob Jones 
          lived over there in Duke campus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: In the Trinity 
          campus then?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, yes, right 
          across on Broad Street.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What year was 
          it, do you think, that you all moved up here?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I can&acute;t 
          tell you; I just don&acute;t know. I&acute;m seventy-two now.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: So that would 
          have been about in the early twenties or teens.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, no, no, 
          no. I was here in 1971, when they went to war. Yes, I remember that 
          mightily, because I remembered the other day when that big snow came. 
          There was a big snow.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Back then?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, when my 
          grandmother died there was snow on the ground. It reminded me of what 
          happened over there. That&acute;s when the boys went off, the World 
          War I boys. We were living on Mulberry Street, and the train came by 
          carrying the boys off to war.</font></p>

          near the train track, near the station?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, right 
          on the tracks, right on the tracks.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: So you saw 
          the train come that day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes. We got 
          out there, and the boys waved.</font></p>

          have been kind of sad.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No. She was 
          put in an old soldiers&acute; home, I think, somewhere. She died during 
          that snowstorm, and we couldn&acute;t get...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh, she wasn&acute;t 
          up there?</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did you often 
          go back to Samson County after you moved here?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, we would 
          go back; we&acute;d go back to her grave, and my grandaddy&acute;s grave 
          and my uncle&acute;s grave. And then we went one time and stayed with 
          one of my aunts down there, my momma&acute;s sister. And we&acute;ve 
          been there several times, not too often--much as I&acute;d like to go 
          back. But I do go back to the mill. I don&acute;t go in; I just go up 
          and look around.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Are a lot of 
          your friends still over there?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, there&acute;s 
          very few of the old people in there now that was there when I was there. 
          They were really younger than I was when I come out, you see. And then 
          there&acute;s some of them still in there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: How old were

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I think I was 
          about sixty. I had a blood clot in my leg, and I couldn&acute;t work.</font></p>

          mother like?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, she was 
          just like one of us, exactly like one of us.</font></p>

          mean?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: You couldn&acute;t 
          hardly tell the mother from the daughters.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter] 
          Is that right? Because she was so young?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, not that 
          she was that much younger. I don&acute;t know, she was just like I am, 
          I think: just enjoyed anything.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh, she liked 
          to do things with you all?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh yes, yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What did you 
          all used to do, like after work and things?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, we mostly 
          stayed at home, because we had to. We worked ten hours and fifteen minutes 
          a day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Whew! So you 
          would come home real late?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well yes. We&acute;d 
          get home sometimes after dark. And she&acute;d have supper fixed. And 
          if she used to think we were hungry she would bring us something up 
          there to the mill.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: A lot of the 
          mothers did that, came around and brought you lunches and things?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, I would 
          think so.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: But you went 
          home for lunch quite a bit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: We didn&acute;t 
          live too far from the mill, and she could come. Then they finally put 
          a fence around that mill, and she would come and give it to us through 
          the fence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Why did they 
          put that fence up?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I really 
          don&acute;t know. I imagine just for safety, more or less; and it was 
          a good idea.</font></p>

          you when they did that?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I don&acute;t 
          even know; maybe two or three years after I went to work. No, it weren&acute;t 
          that; no, it was longer than that, I&acute;d say five years after I 
          went in.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What would 
          you all do, like, on the weekends and stuff?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, we&acute;d 
          go over to Erwin Park. They had a park over there, and they&acute;d 
          have a band. And then we&acute;d walk up to Hillsborough just to the 
          reservoir--a bunch of girls, you know. We went to church, and then Sundays 
          we&acute;d take a walk up to Hillsborough, way up there at that reservoir. 
          and we&acute;d go over there to the park, and things like that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: That&acute;s 
          pretty over there. I&acute;ll bet it was really pretty then.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, it was; 
          it was a beautiful place. And I went up the road the other week and 
          stopped and looked at that old spring. It&acute;s not like it was then, 
          but still.... We can&acute;t expect to go back to these places and find 
          them like they were when we left, because we&acute;re not like the same 
          thing it was when we left there.</font></p>

          know, I just lost him in October, and he was sick for fourteen years. 
          He didn&acute;t work. But then we bought a home over there up the street.

          just come up. I think he had a brother. He didn&acute;t have but one 
          brother. And he was doing some kind of construction work, I think, before

          fifty-three years old.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: And did she 
          go to school over in North Durham?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh yes. She 
          came to Durham High at seventeen.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: And so you 
          just kept on working after you got married?</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I always said if 
          I hadn&acute;t</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: For sure. When 
          you were a child did anyone else live with you? Did any of your relatives 
          or any boarders or anyone live with you all?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, sometimes 
          Mother would take in a boarder. And then I had a first cousin that come 
          from the country up here that stayed with us a while, &#145;til my momma&acute;s 
          sister moved up here to Durham. That was in 1918; that&acute;s when 
          the flu come, &#145;cause I remember they all had the flu, every one 
          of them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Why did so 
          many people die of the flu back then?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I don&acute;t 
          know. It was something like, I think, this-here swine flu. I think that&acute;s 
          whey they were afraid. We would see them die on 9th Street; you know, 
          we were living on 9th Street. I went to the funerals of two Nevilles 
          boys; it killed them both at the same time, the oldest and the youngest.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Was there a

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did it have 
          anything to do with the same people who ran the mill, or was it completely 
          different?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No. The mill 
          had a cemetery, but they didn&acute;t have a funeral home.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Is that mill

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Where is it?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: It&acute;s 
          up the hill on Burrow Road. You have to go in and back out, because 
          I went to a funeral up there not too long ago.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: They still 
          use that?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes. But this 
          man that was buried there then, he was eighty-something years old. I 
          had known him years and years down there, and I went to his funeral. 
          It&acute;s a beautiful place up there, but it&acute;s scary. I&acute;ve 
          often wanted to go back and go in there with somebody with me.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Maybe you and 
          I could go up there some time, because I&acute;d like to see it. I don&acute;t 
          know where it is. I could come get you.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, we&acute;ll 
          go some day then.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Because I&acute;ve 
          never been up there; I don&acute;t even know where it is.</font></p>

          go together then [laughter]. That must be the key.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, yes. That&acute;s 
          history; let me tell you something, that&acute;s history.</font></p>

          sure!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: It&acute;s 
          the most sacred place you ever seen. I just think it&acute;s the most 
          sacred place. Now we had to get out and walk across the railroad tracks. 
          The only two things that went in there were the family car and hearse.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: And everybody

          to walk.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Because it&acute;s 
          real small?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Because it&acute;s 
          grown up so. I don&acute;t think anybody&acute;ll bother us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: OK [laughter]. 
          I&acute;m not too worried about that. What did your old house on 9th

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: It was a two-storey

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Of course we 
          paid for it. But they would send us some wood out, and the coal out. 
          And the best I remember now, they would take it out of our paycheck.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh, I see. 
          they way it was with you all, with your parents working somewhere else, 
          they would take it out of the children&acute;s paychecks?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes. Well, 
          my daddy didn&acute;t stay at home too much. He stayed out of town carpentering,

          to go to Lakewood Park. I enjoyed it. It was nice. You&acute;d take 
          that streetcar. There was a streetcar that brought us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: You could get 
          all the way to Lakewood on it?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: All for a nickel.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: That&acute;s 
          great.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes. And as 
          far as the times now and the times then, I don&acute;t know. I can&acute;t 
          tell there&acute;s too much difference. I think it&acute;s mostly what 
          you make out of your life; it&acute;s mostly the way you accept these 
          things.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Well, you were 
          saying that you went to church on weekends.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What church 
          did you all go to?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: We went to 
          a Presbyterian. I used to go to a Methodist years ago, but then me and 
          him both belong to the Presbyterian right up there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: You and your 
          husband?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: But when you 
          were little you went to the Methodist?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes. When we 
          were living in the country I went to a Free Will Baptist church.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh? What was 
          that like?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, it was 
          nice. It was over there, the old country church. And go down to the 
          spring and everything. But then I went to the Methodist. The Methodist 
          church stood right up there where that filling station is, just before 
          it goes across to the mill. And the Post Office stood up there right 
          on the other corner, right there where you turn to go across.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: And what was 
          the Methodist church like then?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, it was 
          nice. My boss man went there, Mr. Jones. He&acute;d go to sleep...</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: ...and the 
          old trains would come along and wake him up.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Do you remember 
          any of your ministers there? Were they friends of yours or anything?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, they were 
          all married.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: You got married 
          there in that church?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, yes. But 
          I can&acute;t remember their names. It&acute;s been a little bit too 
          long to remember.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What was your 
          wedding like?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh, it was 
          just a simple one.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did your family 
          come in, or friends?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, there were 
          just a few friends there, just about a half a dozen or so. But that 
          church is gone now; there&acute;s a filling station there, and the church 
          is over on Mott. I don&acute;t know what the name of that one was, the 
          one that was over there on the corner. But I remember mighty well Mr. 
          Jones would say, &#147;Those trains woke me up again.&#148;</font></p>

          Do you think that when your family moved up here, your mother and them, 
          do you think that they knew they were going to stay in Durham? or do 
          you think they thought maybe they would move back to the farm?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I think so. 
          I don&acute;t think we ever aimed to go back; I don&acute;t think we 
          meant to go back.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Do you think 
          they missed it, or they were happy?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I wouldn&acute;t 
          think so. I think we were satisfied. Of course I love the country; I 
          just love to go down to the country now.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did you all 
          keep anything like chickens?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, we did 
          one time. But then there was a city ordinance you couldn&acute;t keep 
          stuff like that. So we all worked. I think Momma was busy doing cooking 
          for us, because we would come home for lunch. And we&acute;d go back 
          there at six o&acute;clock, and she&acute;d have to have supper ready.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Do you remember 
          what it was like when you were at work? Did you get to talk and visit 
          much?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Not too much, 
          no, because the most of the time when I went to work we worked &#145;til 
          Saturday at twelve o&acute;clock, and we didn&acute;t have much time 
          off. And we didn&acute;t get home until six; we didn&acute;t have too 
          much time. And there was enough of us there to keep one another company, 
          there was such a big crowd of us. We&acute;d play with wood puzzles; 
          we played checkers and things like that. And that&acute;s whey I say 
          momma was one of us, because she was right down on the floor with us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter] 
          That must have been great.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well it was, 
          it was. She&acute;d come in. We&acute;d be on the floor playing checkers 
          or something, and she&acute;d get right down there with us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did she keep 
          on staying up in Durham?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did she live 
          with you all?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, she lived 
          with my baby sister; just her and my baby sister stayed there after 
          the rest of us married off.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What did some 
          of your brothers and sisters do?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, one of 
          my brothers worked at Watts Hospital, and one of them worked running 
          a shoe shop. But they both worked in the mill before they got out of 
          it. You see, all children went to work in the mill then; most all of 
          them went to work in the mill. Of course they&acute;d wait a year that 
          the would keep on &#145;til they got them through school and get them 
          in a better job, you see.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: If a mother 
          had gone to work in the mill and she had little children, was there 
          any place where they could stay?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, there really 
          weren&acute;t. I don&acute;t know, she&acute;d have to get the neighbors 
          to keep them or something like that, the best I can remember. Yes, you&acute;d 
          have to get somebody, the neighbors. They didn&acute;t have the nursery 
          schools and things like that they&acute;ve got now, no.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did your mother 
          ever keep other people&acute;s children?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, Momma didn&acute;t 
          keep no children, &#145;cause she had enough of her own to keep. But 
          she would keep boarders.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: You didn&acute;t 
          want to have a big family like the one you grew up in?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, no, not 
          especially, because I worked all my life, and I enjoyed working. So 
          that&acute;s the way it went.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: So you just 
          had to keep on. Did your mother ever work outside the home?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, no.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: She always 
          just...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Except those 
          times that we were on the farm, you know, she&acute;d help work in the 
          garden. But she didn&acute;t ever work; she couldn&acute;t.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did she enjoy 
          the church work-type things?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh yes, yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did she go 
          to all the activities like that?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, she went 
          when she could. And then when Wendy got grown she&acute;d go. She attended 
          the Church of God on Hillsborough Road. And we, when he lived, my husband 
          and I, we would go to the Presbyterian. We didn&acute;t have a car then, 
          and we would walk up to Hillsborough Road even the same right after 
          church to see her. And if she wasn&acute;t there she&acute;d always 
          tell us to wait &#145;til she got there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter] 
          She looked forward to seeing you.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, yes, because 
          that was about the only time we had to go. And it would be cool then; 
          in the summertime if it was cool we could walk up there ourselves. Then 
          she passed away; just sort of went out right easy. That&acute;s the 
          way she wanted it. Of course I&acute;ve seen mine suffer eight long 
          years.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: That's sort 
          of rough.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, it was, 
          but he was a good man. And I shouldn&acute;t worry about it. I don&acute;t 
          know, I weren&acute;t going to. We had things to say.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: It&acute;s 
          still pretty hard though when it really gets you.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I don&acute;t 
          know; I just don&acute;t know. I started downstairs. I mashed the button; 
          the elevator door opened, and I come back quietly.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And I said, &#147;Well, 
          I got up and put my coat on, tied my hair up, and But it&acute;s nice 
          here, because nobody don&acute;t bother me. I go when I please, and 
          he was satisfied. And we could meet the bills, the doctor&acute;s bills.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Well, that&acute;s 
          good. That gives you a lot of security.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, yes. 
          We were independent. I&acute;ve always been independent.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: And you feel 
          like that&acute;s real important to you?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh, I think 
          so. I think that&acute;s all some people&acute;ve got left is their 
          independence. And we have two down here, a brother and a sister who 
          live here. And they won&acute;t let nobody come in. I think they come 
          in once every two weeks to wash. But just like I told , I said, &#147;They&acute;re 
          just independent I told them, I said, &#147;That&acute;s all you&acute;ve 
          got left is your independence, just that.&#148; Now neither one of them 
          can go up the steps, but they get by. And she goes to church every Sunday. 
          And people can do a whole lot.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Do you still 
          go to church?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I&acute;ve 
          not been since my husband passed away, because we&acute;d go there together. 
          But I&acute;ll start back one of these days; It&acute;s going to take 
          some time.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Back to the 
          Presbyterian church?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I don&acute;t 
          know whether I&acute;ll go there or not. I&acute;ll have to ride the 
          bus if I go there. And I have a friend here who goes to . It doesn&acute;t 
          make much difference what church, no.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What is the 
          most important thing as far as going to church to you?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, the Bible 
          and praying things and all, knowing that I&acute;m there where I should 
          be. Well the preacher, the paster, he&acute;s been mighty friendly with 
          me, but he&acute;s in the hospital. He was the preacher up there. Of 
          course the pastor at Presbyterian, now he never did know much about 
          us because we had been away from there so long. And he&acute;s a younger 
          man. Of course I have the picture (I showed it to him one day when we 
          were down there), the picture of the man that baptized me and my husband. 
          Of course the preacher that baptized me is dead, preacher</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">He was at Blackmore

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, I don&acute;t 
          know whether I&acute;ll go back to the Presbyterian, because I&acute;d 
          have to ride the bus. And this woman who has a car, she&acute;d drive 
          me. I&acute;ve been with her when we was able to get out. I&acute;ve

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, no, not 
          too many of them. They mostly worked in the mill, because we lived in

          what if just the father or just...?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: They expected 
          several of the workers, if they were old enough, to work in the mill

          nothing.</font></p>

          two years. And I told someone, the first time I&acute;ve ever this place,

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, and shared 
          a bathroom. There was little bathrooms built up, and we had one on this 
          side and one on this side. And then I remember mighty well when they 
          come in and put water in and put the bathroom in there. I remember mighty 
          well when they didn&acute;t have a bathroom in the mill, I mean a commode 
          in the mill.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Hmm. so you 
          had to</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I went to work 
          before they had a commode up there. But I enjoyed working up there.

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I imagine 
          we done the best we could. I remember we&acute;d hang a stocking up, 
          yes. We&acute;d get one toy, candy, apple and orange and raisins. I 
          will still remember them raisins.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh, at that 
          time they were mostly two or three boys, two or three girls. They&acute;d

          no.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Somebody was 
          telling me something about they had a gang of boys. He said some West

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I think 
          when that happened I weren&acute;t into that. But I think along when 
          my younger sister, the one that&acute;s entered the hospital today, 
          I think that&acute;s when that happened, because they would come from 
          Edgemont down here and go to West Durham. I think that&acute;s where 
          that rocking business come in. The boys would be jealous of the boys 
          in West Durham, you know. That&acute;s the best I can remember. Yes, 
          they&acute;d be rocked, and they&acute;d cause trouble, and this, that

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I wouldn&acute;t 
          think so. They had a few drunks on the street once in a while. That&acute;s 
          about all; that&acute;s really about all. And they had a policeman that 
          walked that beat, back and forth. They had very little trouble, I think.

          in that house. But the company sold that house, and they moved our house 
          across onto 8th Street--it&acute;s Eirdale (Iredale) now. And then we 
          lived there, me and Lee lived there &#145;til he had to quit work. Then 
          we went over on Russell Street and bought a home, and we stayed there

          No, the doctors would come out to you, because I remember that 1918

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did they live 
          around there?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No. They lived 
          up in Hickston.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did any of 
          them work at the mill?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, nothing 
          except janitors. And we had a colored woman who&acute;d come in singing 
          and pump out the commode. She&acute;d come in singing. They had a trough 
          there with some hoses--they were out there in the country, the commodes--a 
          wooden trough. And she&acute;d come in singing; she&acute;d turn the 
          water on and go right out there. And then we had a janitor, a colored 
          janitor. Well, they had some colored men, I think, out there in one 
          part, but there weren&acute;t no women. No, there was no colored people 
          in it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: And do you 
          remember when they first started to integrate the mill?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, they 
          started it since I come out.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh, I see. 
          Oh, you mean there weren&acute;t any black people for a long time?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Not that I&acute;ve 
          got nothing against them, because I have some good colored friends right 
          down here. I sure do. But they just hadn&acute;t ever passed the rule 
          or whatever it is that they had to work.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Would there 
          have been blacks in your church, or anything like that? In the churches?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, they 
          wouldn&acute;t come to church, not then, I don&acute;t think so. But 
          they go to the And I don&acute;t know whether they have any up at Blackmore 
          Presbyterian or not. Seems like somebody said they did and somebody 
          said they didn&acute;t. I don&acute;t know; I never had But I do know 
          that the people next door to me here, they have black and white at their 
          church. I think they go to Assembly of God. I think the black and the 
          white, from what I have heard people say that work in the mill, they&acute;re 
          getting along all right there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: That&acute;s 
          good. You were saying how you remembered World War I and the boys going 
          off.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What else do 
          you remember about that war and everything?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I don&acute;t 
          remember too much about the war business, because I was young and we 
          had nobody to go. But now World War II, I had my brother. But I remember 
          when they come back.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: From World 
          War I?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes. I remember 
          when they come back.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What was that 
          like?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: They come back 
          in the mill and went to work just like the rest of us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Was there a 
          rush in the mill, like a pick-up?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well no, I 
          wouldn&acute;t think so. There might be a rush now if they had to put 
          a bunch of servicemen back in, but at that time...I think it was understood.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What do you 
          remember about the Depression hitting West Durham?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: We lived through 
          it [laughter], that&acute;s about all. There&acute;s been a whole lot 
          of Depressions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Do you remember 
          the Great Depression, like when the bank closed and everything?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, that&acute;s 
          when that bank closed right there. We were living right in front of 
          it. But I didn&acute;t have no money in there. I don&acute;t think nobody 
          was very much I have a friend, and I imagine she knows some of that, 
          but I don&acute;t think she ever got it [laughter]--just a little bit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Do you remember 
          back when your parents were living on the farm? Did they ever talk any 
          about anything about the Farmers&acute; Alliance down there? Did they 
          ever go to any of the meetings or anything for that?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I don&acute;t 
          think they ever had any meetings where we lived there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: So about the 
          only time... Would they get together, like, for church and things? And 
          when else would they see their neighbors?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, they 
          would visit, you know.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did many people 
          from Sampson County move up to here to other mills?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I really don&acute;t 
          know; I don&acute;t know about how many moved from Sampson County, to 
          tell you the truth. I did know some that come from down in that section. 
          I had a brother-in-law that come from there. Of course he&acute;s dead 
          now. And then I think there&acute;s people here, several brothers and 
          two sisters that moved here; they&acute;re still living. But they weren&acute;t 
          from Sampson County. The Parkers, I don&acute;t know whether they were 
          from Sampson County or no.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did your daughter 
          go to school over there? Where did she go to elementary school?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: She went to 
          Durham High.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Where did she 
          start?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, she started 
          at Southside. Then she went to E.K. Polk. She went to junior high at 
          E.K. Polk, then she went to Durham High School.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: E.K. Polk is 
          now... They have moved that up there?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: And did she 
          like school and everything?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh yes, she 
          was a good student.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No. But she

          really have to push.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Would your 
          mother go downtown to Durham, or would she mostly shop out in West Durham?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, there 
          weren&acute;t too much to shop in West Durham. I think there was one 
          clothing store there, and a grocery store. Old Mr. Davis run a grocery 
          store there; he still runs the Davis Hardware there. It&acute;s not 
          Davis now, It&acute;s somebody else; but his son has taken over. And 
          there weren&acute;t too many stores in there.</font></p>

          a grocery store up the road (Boyds, I believe). Then I believe they 
          had one; Davis had a store.</font></p>

          come in the street and talk to you just like I&acute;m talking to you. 
          He&acute;d stop. And this Mr. Jones I worked for, he said we were his 
          children.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter] 
          What was his family like?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh, they were 
          nice; they were nice. One of them was a schoolteacher. He died with 
          the cancer; we would go to the hospital to see him. We&acute;d go down 
          the street sometimes at night; we would all go in there to see him. 
          And then after they brought him back home his wife fell and broke her 
          hip. And after we&acute;d quit working we&acute;d gather and go down 
          Broad--he lived on down Broad across from the hospital. We would go 
          down Broad and see him. And then he went to Asbury, and he moved there 
          then when they built the new Asbury Church. I went to his funeral; I 
          think that&acute;s the first Mason funeral I ever went to.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What was that

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, every 
          one of them wore a little apron. And they put Mr. Jones&acute;s little 
          apron on his casket.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Because he 
          was a Mason?</font></p>

          realize that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I believe it&acute;s 
          a Mason; I&acute;m sure it&acute;s a Mason. That&acute;s the only funeral, 
          I think, I ever went to that they wore the little aprons. But he was 
          a wonderful guy. He was a just like of us--and Mr. Erwin was too!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What church 
          did he go to?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Who?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Mr. Erwin.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: He was Episcopal. 
          He built that little Episcopal church in West Durham.</font></p>

          stone...?</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh yes, yes. 
          And then right across the street there (that was years and years ago), 
          up over the Post Office--of course he owned everything--he had a hall 
          up there, and he had Sunday School up there. And I went to Sunday School 
          up there. And I will never forget it, one Christmas he give me a parasol. 
          He give all of us womens a parasol. And he would come there and teach 
          us. But Mr. Bill Erwin was a wonderful person. Anybody wouldn&acute;t 
          think that the man had the money, the job and everything that he had. 
          And we&acute;ve been to his house and picked grapes off his vines.</font></p>

          where he lived, in West Durham?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, the Convalescent 
          Home, Hillcrest. They went in there, And I hated, I hated that they 
          put a front to it, because I always thought that was the prettiest little 
          place I&acute;ve ever seen. I hated that they hid that front. They built 
          onto the back, but now they&acute;re coming in here and fixing the front, 
          hiding all that lovely, pretty little house.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Right, right.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I never was

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, Gus McKeever, 
          the younger McKeever, was a wonderful person, but I didn&acute;t like 
          his daddy for nothing! [laughter] It&acute;s all right there on tape.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter]

          He works out here in the Southland Insurance Company, Gus does. Gus

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I&acute;d say 
          there were thirty-five or forty, or something like that. They weren&acute;t 
          like this rock and roll stuff, no.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter] 
          Do you remember any of their names who were in the band?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, it&acute;s 
          been so long. That was just long ago.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What happened? 
          Or how come they didn&acute;t ...?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I don&acute;t 
          know; I really don&acute;t know. I imagine everybody died or</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What else did 
          they have over there besides the music?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: It seems to 
          me like they had...I don&acute;t remember whether they had a skating 
          rink over there or not. The reason the park went down, they built the 
          auditorium over there, and everyone was coming. Then they had a swimming 
          pool in there. That park was more or less for people just to go sit 
          around and talk. Then when they opened up that auditorium over there, 
          then they opened up the swimming pool, and then all the operation over 
          there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did they have 
          any elections or anything before it was incorporated into West Durham?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I don&acute;t 
          know whether they had any elections or not. That&acute;s the only time 
          they ever runned it [laughter].</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter] 
          I guess, then, they did.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I&acute;ll 
          tell you were I voted. It was a place down on Broad Street, a little 
          old shack of a house. I was voting against them incorporating West Durham.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh, you were?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: West Durham 
          That&acute;s the only time I&acute;ve ever voted. I lost; I didn&acute;t 
          vote no more.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: You haven&acute;t 
          voted since?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, never.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Not even for 
          the president?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Why did you 
          decide that?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I decided, 
          &#147;I lost then; I wouldn&acute;t vote no more.&#148; [laughter]</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: [laughter] 
          Why did you want to vote against the incorporation?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh, to get 
          out of the mill that long.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: To get away 
          from the job that long, I think. The let us go out. We were gone about 
          two or three hours.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh, I see.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Then we used 
          to have a community house down on Hillsborough Road. We&acute;d go down 
          there, and play games and things like that. You know, the company owned 
          that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh they did?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I think that&acute;s 
          gone now. Nobody ever could have gone</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Of course it used 
          to be a good place; and it is still a good place, I think.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: I do too. I 
          live on Watts Street; I have a room there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: How far down 
          from Broad Street?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Close to East 
          Campus, over in the big trees.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh, oh. Well, 
          I like that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: It&acute;s 
          pretty.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Now I tell 
          you what I do. My daughter lives up on Elm Street I told you yesterday. 
          And if I go to Northgate, a lot of times I&acute;ll...[interruption]</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: You all weren&acute;t 
          born in the hospital, were you?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh no, no.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Were you born 
          at home?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes. I think 
          Momma&acute;s two last children, the doctor delivered them; and the 
          others, a midwife, I&acute;d say, delivered them, a colored woman.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh yes?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Do you remember 
          her?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: What was her 
          name?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Deb Matthis; 
          she lived in Sampson County. She&acute;s dead now. But I&acute;d say 
          about five years ago we went down there and found her daughter; we did. 
          And believe it or not, I hadn&acute;t seen her in fifty years, and when 
          she come to that door I recognized her.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Amazing! And 
          does her daughter still do that?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I don&acute;t 
          know. We&acute;ve not been back since my sister died four years ago 
          this past September; we&acute;ve not been back. But we are planning 
          going back when my sister gets out of the hospital. You see, it&acute;s 
          been so many years I couldn&acute;t get out to go over.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: You would just 
          go there to visit?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh, we&acute;d 
          just go one day and back that same day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh, I see; 
          that&acute;s a long ride.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: We&acute;d 
          go visit the church, the old church and around. Of course she might 
          be dead; I don&acute;t know.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: How about your 
          brothers and sisters that were born up here in West Durham? Was there 
          a midwife here?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: One of them, 
          a doctor came, my youngest sister. And then my youngest brother, they 
          had a doctor then deliver too.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Were they the 
          only two that were born up here?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: They were the 
          only two born with a doctor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh. And who 
          delivered the rest? Or who came?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Midwife they 
          called them, I recon. We called her Aunt Deb.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: She came up 
          here?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, no, no, 
          no.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh no, just 
          in Sampson County.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: She borned 
          them there. See, women had all their own children at home. And the doctor 
          would come out to the house for an emergency. I had a sister that had 
          one boy delivered at home, and he ain&acute;t .</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did many people 
          that started working in the mills ever go up to Liggett-Myers to get 
          a job? Did they ever switch?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I wouldn&acute;t 
          think. I think when they got in that mill, they stayed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: They just stayed 
          there. Because they had their friends there?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Yes, yes. I 
          think they just stayed there. More or less, when one would finish school 
          or get up in school they would to to Liggett-Myers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Do you remember 
          your first day at work, when you first went there?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I was scared 
          to death, I know that. I don&acute;t really remember the first day, 
          but I remember I was scared to death.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: I&acute;ll 
          bet. It must have been so scary, with the machines and all those strangers 
          [laughter]. Do you remember like who came and taught you how to do your 
          work and everything?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No; It&acute;s 
          been too long.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Was it hard 
          to learn to do it right?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, I don&acute;t 
          remember now. It&acute;s been too many years. It weren&acute;t easy, 
          I don&acute;t think.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did you get 
          paid by the time you were there, or how much you did?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I got thirty 
          cents a day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: It didn&acute;t 
          matter how much you got done?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: I got thirty 
          cents a day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Boy!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, later 
          years you had to do so much to get paid, just so much, in later years.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: You know, they 
          got more strict about leaving and coming and going. Did they get more 
          strict about breaks and everything like that? Like now...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Well, not exactly. 
          It used to be you&acute;d leave when you got ready and come back when 
          you got ready. They might ask you to come back. But in later years, 
          if you got your job caught up you could leave.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Did they have 
          breaks every so often, just for people to...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: No, not in 
          the job I had. When I got caught up I got to break. At Liggett-Myers 
          and American I think they have somebody to relieve you, so they do help 
          you out.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Oh, I see.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: You just have 
          to work fast and get caught up and go, just so they wouldn&acute;t catch 
          you before you got back [laughter]. It weren&acute;t bad; it weren&acute;t 
          bad. I was satisfied with it. The work got done. And the life I had 
          in Erwin, yes, I loved everything in it. And I&acute;m satisfied here 
          where I&acute;m at. I&acute;m just thankful that I lived to be seventy-three 
          years old and able to go.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">LR: Right. That&acute;s 
          great, to still be able to do everything. Inside the mill, was it clean 
          and pleasant?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TW: Oh yes. They 
          had to keep it pretty clean.</font></p>
