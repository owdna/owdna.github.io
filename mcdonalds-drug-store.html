<h2>John McDonald: This Old Drugstore</h2>


          McDonald's Drugstore has been on Ninth Street in Durham for more than
          80 years. When I interviewed John McDonald, I asked him how things had
          changed over all that time. I guess I expected him to lay into the chain
          stores that have taken over the pharmacy business or to feel uneasy
          about the new tattoo and body-piercing parlor next door.

          just south of Ninth Street on Erwin Road. You can still see a fairly
          undeveloped area to the north and Duke's East Campus (far right).</font></p>
        <p>Instead, he looked around the old pharmacy, with its antique soda fountain
          and soothing blue bottles of Hunter's Sarspirilla and Cow Balm, and
          he said, matter of factly: "See that south wall? When I was little,
          there used to be a booth there."</p>
        <p>Not much has changed at McDonald's Drugstore. Six days a week, John
          and Frances McDonald still greet children with warm smiles and the best
          milkshakes and vanilla Cokes in town. The dress shop owner next door
          knows to go behind the counter and help herself, and the walls are adorned
          with hundreds of school photos, mementos from customers whose families
          have been coming to McDonald's for generations.</p>
        <p>Their drugstore might not carry every gewgaw that you can buy at a
          shopping mall or chain store. But as I watched a crowd of gleeful children
          sipping orangeades while an older woman chatted with Mrs. McDonald about
          her granddaughter's piano recital, I got the feeling that maybe their
          customers were coming there for things that money can't buy.</p>

        <p>I was brought up in the drugstore. My father opened in 1914 on Main
          Street. He moved to Ninth Street in 1916 in a two-story wooden building.
          He moved in this location in 1922. I went to school at E.K. Powe, two
          blocks down the street here. When I was big enough, instead of walking
          home, I'd walk down to the drugstore. I'd sit over in the booth there
          and do my homework.</p>
        <p>West Durham was a little community by itself, basically involved with
          Erwin Mills, which made sheets and pillow cases. The small stores up
          and down Ninth Street provided for the needs mostly of the people that
          worked for Erwin Mills. You had a couple little barber shops, a couple
          little shoe shops, a couple grocery stores.</p>
        <p>Most of the recreation was provided by Erwin Auditorium, which was
          owned by the mill. They had an indoor swimming pool, a bowling alley,
          a soda shop, a library, a tennis court. This whole field up here where
          Wellspring Grocery is now was a baseball field. And they had movies
          three nights a week at the auditorium. Basically, everybody stayed pretty
          much in West Durham, and most people knew each other.</p>
        <p>Things were so quiet, people left their front doors open. They didn't
          lock up anything. When I was delivering, a lot of times I'd go bang
          at the front door, maybe seven or eight o'clock at night. Wasn't anybody
          coming to answer, I'd just open the door and put the prescriptions on
          the kitchen table and walk out and go on about my business.</p>
        <p>During the Great Depression, things were not going well financially
          for anyone. Families were a little larger in those days, and not enough
          income. Quite often, people would come down to the drugstore and say,
          "Doc, I've got some sick children. I just don't have the money right
          now. Can you fill these prescriptions and let me pay you when I can?"
          And my father did.</p>
        <p>They were hard times. It was very difficult, because he was having
          to pay his suppliers. For a long time, I kept some checks on the Bank
          of West Durham, which was two doors down from us and went under during
          the Depression. Checks were returned for as little as $1.25 and $1.50
          for insufficient funds. I kept them as mementoes of harder days.</p>
        <p><img src="/old/graphics/history/e065.jpg" width="404" height="301"></p>
        <p>When I got out of high school in 1938, I got a job at Erwin Mills and
          was living home and saving my money. I made the sum total of $11.88
          a week. Strangely enough, even weavers and loom fixers-adults-were making
          $14 to $15 a week. They weren't high paid either. The big majority of
          the people lived in mill houses, which were all around the area. I worked
          there about 15 months, then I went on to the University of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Back in those days, doctors made house calls. They'd go see patients
          at Watts Hospital, which is about 4 blocks up from here. At night, after
          they finished their hospital rounds, they'd come out around the community.
          If someone had a sick child, they'd call his office and he'd go by.</p>
        <p>Quite often, the people, knowing the doctor was in the neighborhood,
          they'd send a friend over and say, "Listen, we've got a sick child here."
          So they'd make house calls around the neighborhood, then call the prescriptions
          in, and we would deliver them on a bicycle. I don't know many pharmacies
          that do that anymore!</p>
        <p>Fifty years ago, when I first got my pharmacy license, I knew most
          of the people in the community and their families. You saw people in
          all stages of life. You saw the happy side of life-the babies, the new
          births-and you saw the sad part, when people were sick with fatal diseases.</p>
        <p>The children stayed pretty much in the neighborhood. Many would follow
          the family into the mill. When a lot of them got married, they just
          moved three or four blocks away. If you had given good service to the
          parents, then you inherited another family. You built your business
          on your past experiences. It was very pleasant.</p>
        <p>Now most of the people we wait on are strangers, because this area
          is more transient now. We have a few regular customers, but not nearly
          as many as we used to have. Like the pharmacists, they're kind of disappearing.</p>
        <p>Years ago, people would come in the drugstore for little minor things.
          For years, we had a butcher shop down the street. If the guy had a little
          nick or cut, he'd come up to the store and say, "Hey doc, bandage this
          for me." We did a lot of that in those days. We could recommend some
          over-the-counter products for minor things as well. We did a lot of
          counter prescribing, I'd guess you'd call it.</p>
        <p>There was also right much of the home remedy-type things, those that
          were passed along from the grandmother to the mother to the daughter.
          We still have a few of the old products. This morning a lady came in
          looking for a product called Father John's. Her mother had used it on
          her when she was a child, and she said she had to drive many miles to
          find an old store that had it.</p>
        <p>They'd also come for the soda fountain. People used to meet at the
          soda fountain in the mornings. They'd come down and have a Coca-Cola
          and pass the time of day.</p>
        <p>Once there must have been 25 or so of these little neighborhood stores
          in Durham. They're all gone now. But I still enjoy the street and the
          people. And Frances loves the children. She loves the older folks too.
          Have you noticed all the pictures of the young people they bring in
          and give her?</p>
        <p>We're going to keep the store pretty much as it is, because we're enjoying
          it. The street has changed, the neighborhood has changed. Everything
          pretty much has changed, except for this old drugstore.</p>
