<h2>West Durham Church of God</h2>

        <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Church of God 
          was organized in 1937 on Monkey Bottom's Case Street in a small plank 
          church of rough-cut pine.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">After World War 
          II, Pastor Roland Verrico arrived to find a congregation of 23 members. 
          His task was difficult: build membership in a town dominated by Baptists 
          and Methodists. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">According to the 
          original cornerstone, the "new" West Durham Church of God was built 
          in 1947 -- at the corner of Hillsborough and Knox. The small congregation 
          worshiped in temporary quarters at the construction site while the church 
          was being built. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">At first, Pastor 
          Verrico lived in a mill-provided house on Rutherford Street. In 1949, 
          the church bought its parsonage at 1022 Rosehill Avenue (a Sears &amp; 
          Roebuck house built in 1928). "That house saw a lot of praying," </font><font size="2">Rev. 
          Verrico died shortly after the conversation (August 2001).</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Below is a photo of the church on Easter Sunday (ca. 1954).</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">In 1986, the new 
          West Durham Church of God was built on Horton Road -- where you can 
          still see the white cornerstone in the brick wall next to the doors. 
          Today, an ABC store stands on the Hillsborough Road site (below). </font></p>
