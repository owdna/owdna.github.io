<h2>Bull Durham</h2>

        <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">At the end of 
          the 19th century, the Duke family decided to diversify its tobacco holdings 
          and began to invest in other business ventures. One of their first investments 
          was the Erwin Cotton Mill No. 1 in West Durham (partly because it needed 
          mechanical looms to make matching cotton bags for its new cigarette-making 
          machines).</font></p>
