          <font size="2">Erwin Mills was shut down in 1986. All the people in 
          Old West Durham lost their jobs and they didn't have any money. On 9th 
          Street the stores were shut down. There was no blue jeans. All of the 
          streets of Old West Durham were number streets but 9th Street is still 
          here. E.K. Powe is in the middle of Old West Durham.</font></p>

        West Durham Graded School was built in 1912-13. Note that Ninth Street is a dirt 
        road with a drainage ditch. 1913 article in the Herald expressed dismay about 
        all the drainage ditches and mosquitoes in West Durham.</p>

          Dragons won three national age-group football championships. Front line 
          (left to right): Fred Anders, Jimmy Pulley, Charles Dukes, Commie Rigsbee, 
          Sumter Brawley, Craig Moon and Bill Simpson. Backfield (left to right): 
          Bobbie Burns, Paul Reeves, Ralph Dennis and Charles Andrews (1948). 
          In the old days, girls only played in the upper field (by West Knox) 
          and boys only played in the lower field (by Green Street). In 1958, 
          the students demanded to play together and the boy-girl separation was 
          removed. </p>

          West Durham Graded School No. 1 was built around 1898 
          at the corner of Swift and Caswell (new apartment building today). 
          Two schools were combined here: Piney Grove School on Swift Avenue 
          (where First Baptist Church of Durham started) and Northside 
          (where, according to old mill workers, Vin Rouge stands today).<br>

          can see the old cafeteria basement (see doors and windows at downhill 
          end of building). Students ate in the basement under what are now the 
          administrative offices.</p>
