            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Let me begin by 
              saying that no one in our family attended this church, but we all felt 
              close to the people who were members and worshipped here. The reason 
              we felt so much apart of this fellowship was due to the proximity of 
              our house at 807 Hale St., being located next door to the church. Our 
              parents, Lewis and Louvenia Smith purchased this house around 1951. 
              It was the former house of William Julius and Mattie Wilson. It was 
              during this time our family shared a common city water meter with the 
              church. Once a month, someone would come over and visit with us, and 
              pay their part of the water bill. In the summer months, during services, 
              the windows of the church would always be open. This afforded us the 
              opportunity for many years to enjoy listening to sermons by &quot;Preacher 
              Williams&quot; and singing of hymns by the congregation. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1908 or 1909 
              Rev. W.A. Way organized the Pilgrim Holiness Church. According to retired 
              postal employee and long time resident Winfred Jones, the original church 
              was located at 2306 Gin Street. It was near Hale Street and before the 
              &quot;new log church&quot; was built. Winfred remembers attending church services 
              in this small white frame building that had a steeple. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mr. &amp; Mrs. 
              William Julius Wilson, Sr. owned a house nearby at 2402 Gin St. The 
              Wilson Family also owned and leased a small store beside their house. 
              In the late 1930's, this store was leased&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">to Arnold T. Parrish, 
              who operated a fish market here. Beginning around 1940, W. J. Wilson, 
              Jr. (Dub), opened a grocery store at this location under the name &quot;Wilson 
              &amp; Son&quot;. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today this structure 
              at 2404 Gin Street has been converted into a tailor shop with the business 
              name of &quot;Stitches&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mr. W.J. Wilson, 
              Sr. was a meat cutter and employed by Floyd B. Wright and later Dewey 
              Scarboro at 1000 Ninth Street.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the early 1930's, 
              the church membership decided they needed a larger building. It was 
              at this time, W.J. Wilson, Sr., who was serving as the Pastor at Pilgrim 
              Holiness Church, told the congregation, &quot;that if they would construct 
              a log building&quot;, he would donate part of his land as a building site. 
              The church membership accepted his offer and agreed to build the new 
              church using logs. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In order to have 
              enough space for the new church foundation, Mr. Wilson had to move his 
              house that he was renting at the time to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Burkett Jones, 
              parents of Winfred. The house which faced Hillsborough Rd. (Spelled 
              Hillsboro) was moved around to face Hale St. and then moved over to 
              the location it stands today, at 807 Hale Street.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The logs for the 
              new building cost $.25 cents apiece and were hauled in and stored across 
              the street from the church construction site. Young teenage boys in 
              the neighborhood joined in and helped the adults clean bark off the 
              logs. They used sharp tools, such as axes and knives to accomplish this. 
              Once the logs were cleaned, they were taken to the building site. Here 
              they were notched, wired together and cement was used to fill the space 
              between the logs.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The new Pilgrim 
              Church at 805 Hale Street was completed in 1934.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For many years 
              the church was heated in winter months with a coal stove. The building 
              originally had a partial basement and according to Winfred, some of 
              the preachers lived here.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">During some of 
              the earlier years, ministers were paid about $3.00 a week with &quot;free 
              will offerings&quot; taken up at the services. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A few years after 
              the church was built, The Jones Family moved from Hale St. to 2613 Hillsboro 
              Road near the Ideal Sundry.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One evening, while 
              attending worship service at Pilgrim Holiness Church with his mother, 
              Mozell and brother Curtis, Winfred recalls the following story. He relates 
              that his mother, after praying about what she would give, put $.25 cents 
              in the offering plate. Winfred remembers that his father, Burkett had 
              given the money to her to purchase two gallons of oil for their cook 
              stove. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the way back 
              home that evening, the boys asked their mother how she was going to 
              replace the money to purchase the oil. Her reply to them was not to 
              worry, because &quot;The Lord will provide for our needs&quot;.&nbsp; When they had 
              arrived home, Mrs. Jones told her husband about the &quot;offering&quot; and how 
              she felt led to use the money at church, rather then to purchase oil 
              with it. Knowing how important the oil was to the family, Mrs. Jones 
              again repeated to her husband, not to worry about it, &quot;That God would 
              meet their needs&quot;.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The next morning, 
              after Mrs. Jones had used the last remaining oil to cook breakfast for 
              her family, she went to the garden to &quot;chop weeds&quot;. While helping his 
              mother clear weeds, Winfred witnessed her&nbsp; &quot;chop&quot; a bright metal object 
              out of the ground. The bright object they saw lying on the ground --- 
              was a quarter!&nbsp; After his mother picked the coin up, she remarked, &quot; 
              I told you that God would provide&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In March 1948, 
              Preacher Reese Farlow married Winfred and Peggy Dalehite Jones in Pilgrim 
              Holiness Church.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Adrian Jones, brother 
              of Winfred, grew up in this church and recalls attending sunday school 
              classes in the choir loft above the sanctuary. The class had eight boys 
              and their teacher was</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mr. Joe Phillips. 
              Adrian relates jokingly, that publicly he tells people that seven of 
              the boys were very mischievous, but privately he confesses there were 
              eight. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On many occasions 
              when the boys would become disruptive and their attention span very 
              short, Mr. Phillips would stop teaching. It was at this time, he would 
              go around to each member of the class and lay his hand on their heads. 
              He would tell them, &quot;If I cannot make you behave, I can pray for you&quot;. 
              His prayer for each boy in the class would be, that when they became 
              adults, they would be ministers or go into the missionary field.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today, Adrian Jones 
              is an ordained minister and lives in Nolensville, TN. The other seven 
              members of his class are either ministers or have dedicated their lives 
              doing missionary work. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ken Hogan remembers 
              as a young boy attending sunday school here around 1945. He recalls 
              that to go to his class, there was a trap-door about 4x6 feet wide that 
              had to be opened inside the church sanctuary. The door was hinged and 
              secured to the wall with a hook. This entrance led down a stairway into 
              the basement, where classes were held. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ken also remembers 
              helping older men and other young boys in the neighborhood remove dirt 
              from underneath the building. Some of these neighborhood workers were 
              affectionately known as &quot;The Skunk Hollow Gang&quot;. These men used hand 
              tools, buckets and wheelbarrows to dig out and enlarge the original 
              partial basement into a full basement. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to long 
              time member, Betty Wayne Waller Blalock, in 1968&nbsp;due to a merger 
              with&nbsp;The Wesleyan Church, the name was changed from Pilgrim Holiness 
              to Trinity Wesleyan.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The church building 
              remained a log structure until around 1976, when during renovation; 
              the logs were covered with bricks. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sadly, August 19, 
              1978 on Saturday Morning around 4:00 A.M., a fire heavily damaged the 
              church building. Unable to continue services here, Howerton-Bryan Funeral 
              Chapel opened it's doors to the church membership. They continued meeting 
              at this location until it was decided that the fire damaged church building 
              would not be repaired. It was at this time that some of the members 
              joined the First Wesleyan Church that was located at 922 Ninth Street.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Listed <u>alphabetically</u> are known ministers of the Pilgrim Holiness / Trinity Wesleyan Church. 
              They were Preachers Verlin Busick, J.R. Catlett, William S. Deal, Reese

            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A few months after 
              this destructive fire, the building at 805 Hale Street was sold to my 
              parents Lewis and Louvenia Smith. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1985, my father 
              sold the former Pilgrim Holiness/ Trinity Wesleyan property to my nephew 
              Harlan Mangum and his wife Linda.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Mangums completely 
              remodeled the building and converted it into a beauty salon. Today,
