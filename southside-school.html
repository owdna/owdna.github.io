		<p>Old Durham school board records indicate two issues that reflected 
		    attitudes of the day... Should teachers who marry resign from the system? 
		    And, should students be allowed to dance together at the Senior Banquet? 
		    In 1929, &quot;a member of the Teacher's Committee suggested that the school 
		    board consider passing a resolution in the near future to the effect 
		    that teachers marrying while in service will be considered as resigning 
		    their positions as teachers in the Durham School System.&quot; And, a 1930 
		    entry from the School Board records states, &quot;An informal request was 
		    made from an advisor of girls in the high school to allow the students 
		    to dance at their annual Senior Banquet. While the board had no regulation 
		    governing the matter, it had been an unwritten custom for a number of 
		    years not to allow dancing in the high school. After considerable discussion 
		    of the matter, it was a consensus of opinion of the board that no change 
		    in policy be made.&quot; (source: Wayne Smith) </p>

		  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bonnie Blue grew up in Monkey 
		    Bottom in West Durham on what he calls &quot;the hillside.&quot; Monkey Bottom 
		    was near present-day Ninth Street, a neighborhood peopled by the poor 
		    who took textile jobs at Erwin Mills. Bonnie Blue's father worked in 
		    Erwin Mills. Bonnie took a job there as a doffer in 1942, a few months 
		    before he entered the war. He smoked his first cigar at age 5... &quot;I 
		    was hoeing cotton and tobacco even before I could walk good,&quot; he said... 
		    He remembers his youth, when the mill released his dad early on Saturday 
		    afternoons. &quot;Me and my father used to walk years ago, from where I told 
		    you on that hill. We'd get us some tow bags to put our fishing gear 
		    in. Then we'd set out in in the afternoon and walk across town to 751, 
		    below where the bypass is now, go down through the woods to a little 
		    spot on New Hope Creek, set out our turtle hooks and stay there all 
		    night long,&quot; he said... &quot;In the morning, we'd have seven, 
		    eight turtles. Then we'd pack up and walk all the way back.&quot;... 
		    His mother would clean the catch, &quot;throw in tomatoes, 'taters, 
		    carrots, everything you put in a Brunswick stew,&quot; and invite neighbors 
		    for the feast (source: N&amp;O, 5/12/94)</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">.</font></p>
