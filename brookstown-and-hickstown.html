<h2>Brookstown and Hickstown Communities</h2>


<!--Content of Page-->
	<div id="content">
		<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Text-Photos" --> South and east of the Durham Freeway and Swift was the African American settlement of Brookstown. Some residents worked in the tobacco factory and Erwin Mills while others worked at the Fitzgerald family brickyards &ndash; one of Durham's largest Black-owned businesses. Many of Durham's factories and mills were built using Fitzgerald bricks.<br />
		<br />
		From Swift, west to Anderson, was part of the Erwin Mill village called Monkey Bottom. Farther west was the community of Hickstown, near Trent.<br />
		<br />
		The new east-west expressway destroyed hundreds of houses in the three communities. In the 1970s, Duke tore down 450 mill houses to make room for its new Central Campus. (You can see granite curbs, from the old mill village, down by the large pond in Duke Gardens.) <br />

            lost when the Durham Freeway was built.<br />

            Long shot of back yard, with five
            women and girls behind a house (near present-day Casewell and Powe).
            Today, the house is gone and the Durham Freeway now runs just past the
            old telephone pole.
          	The African-American settlement of Brookstown (today, mostly under the freeway and along
            either side of Swift Street) was once dotted with dozens of one-story
            frame houses. Moses Hester owned a house on West Pettigrew (near Swift)
            which served as both a carpenter's shop and a church. Most residents
            of Brookstown worked either in the tobacco factories or at Erwin Mills.

          Others worked at
            the Marvin Teer Brickyard located near Swift and Faber streets. The
            brickyard was later sold to Samuel Fitzgerald who operated the famous
            Fitzgerald Brickyard. According to historian Alice Eley Jones, Erwin
            Mills and several other factories in Durham were built using the famous
            Fitzgerald bricks. The old brickyard site is now Duke's Freeman Center
            for Jewish Life (and if you look in the underbrush you can still see
            a brick or two).

            their teachers on the steps of the West End School, located on Ferrell
            Street, near present-day Swift Street.
          Farther west stood
            the settlement of Hickstown (where Duke's Central Campus stands today).
            Hickstown was named after landowner Hawkins Hicks -- whose tombstone
            can still be found on the eastern edge of the Erwin Mills cemetery.
          In 1978, City and
            State leaders sought to push the Durham Freeway through Brookstown and
            Hickstown. In response, a coalition of community residents and progressive
            whites worked to save Hickstown by rebuilding it behind the VA medical
            center. This effort resulted in a $10 million settlement for the Crest
            Street community that, for the first time in U.S. history, used highway
            relocation funds to benefit an entire neighborhood instead of individual
            homeowners.
          Today, Hicks Street
            (near the St. Francis Animal Hospital) stands as a quiet reminder of
            the old community.<br />
